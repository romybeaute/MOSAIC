          "I've had it since I was a child, but almost no one has ever understood it.",
          "When I thought, \"It's interesting how the way I manipulate various concepts in my head and construct thoughts differs depending on the time and situation,\" initially I think in a massive, rough way without words, simultaneously handling many meanings, so at first it feels like several lumps of thought, like buckets or containers, are lined up in my head (similar to how this site has various videos embedded on one page), and I think for about 0.5 seconds, and then when I speak or write it down and think while expressing it with words, I use words, and it takes the amount of time corresponding to the amount of text in the quotation marks (same as reading aloud).",
          "Also, the tone of this \"automatic reading aloud\" varies depending on the style of writing, the sender, and emotions.",
          "The words are usually based on their personalities, but the content mostly benefits me.",
          "When I was a child, my inner monologue was clearly in the form of conversations with others, but as an adult it has become completely self-directed.",
          "② Unlike the visual version, an original, non-existent actor is providing the voice.",
          "It seems that inner speech occurs when I need to make quick decisions, but I don't rely on inner speech when I need to think for a long time (within 5 minutes).",
          "When thinking for a while, I ask myself (simplified) questions in my head.",

          "Therefore, at night before bed, when I am completely alone and not outputting anything to the real world, my inner speech doesn't stop, and my head gets noisy.",
          "Also, when I remember something or recall something concrete, like the food mentioned in the example, an image (more like a picture) pops into my head.",

          "Come to think of it, it's pretty noisy.",
          "I always thought I was primarily an auditory thinker, but it was interesting to see how much I rely on visual and tactile input, both in my inner speech and in my perception of external stimuli.",
          "Even when I do remember, I recall it as a memory of having talked it over in my head.",
          "As far as I can remember, I started using it when I was 4 years old.",

          "Since there were many examples I didn't have much experience with, other than choosing meals, I was guessing or imagining replacements.",
          "Because I don't seem to ruminate like inner speech, I feel that my memory of taste and smell is weaker than others.",

          "I also hear a voice reading the characters simultaneously when I'm typing or writing characters.",
          "It's like speaking words in my head, just like how people speak using words.",
          "Or, text suddenly appears on the wall, and I read it and then speak.",
          "However, when thinking, multiple versions of me appear and start arguing.",
          "I feel like I use both bodily sensations and images of muscle movements, and verbal thinking simultaneously.",
          "First, candidate options appear as bullet points, and from there, I decide visually (intuitively), then imagine the consequences (whether I'll regret it, disadvantages, etc.)",

          "I think my inner speech is similar to how I talk in my dreams (conversations with dream characters).",
          "My thoughts become inner speech, so inner speech is the decision-making process itself.",
          "I've recently felt a decline in the intelligence of my inner monologue (aging?",
          "Besides visuals, there's almost no audio, text, or other information, so I was surprised by the options.",
          "When I'm not thinking, and even sometimes when I am, music is constantly playing in my head.",
          "One day, I found myself able to think in English audio without translating it into Japanese audio.",
          "I hear a voice even when I'm silently reading something.",
          "My presence is absent; I'm being observed.",
          "I can recall auditory and olfactory information if I try.",
          "The proportion of olfactory senses involved varies depending on what I'm imagining.",
          "This is true even when writing this; I translate and verbalize my non-verbal thinking at the same time as outputting, and I can bring it into the verbal space without going through the process of reading it aloud in my mind or verbalizing it as inner speech.",
          "For meals, I'd imagine myself looking at ingredients at the supermarket or walking through a place with restaurants, searching for hints.",
          "In addition to the above, the basic image is that I'm talking to myself and someone else is agreeing with me (so it's not strictly the same as the video in the question) (they will ask questions) (like debugging with an imaginary rubber duck).",
          "I have been diagnosed with ASD and ADHD.",
          "I never even considered that other people…",
          "Regarding the influence on decision-making, I use inner speech to scrutinize decisions I've already made, so it can influence them, but it can also lead me to follow the initial decision, meaning it doesn't always have an influence.",
          "Are there instances where inner speech doesn't influence decision-making, or where inner speech isn't clearly self-aware?",
          "Thank you.",
          "I've had an active imagination since childhood and loved pretend play, so I think of them as imaginary friends.",
          "However, because I have a bad memory, I'm really bad at thinking things through in my head, so when I want to think properly, I write it down on paper.",
          "Sometimes it feels noisy.",
          "I don't have inner speech that's only text, but I have had dreams that were just text (writing).",
          "I hope you will separate thinking methods and conversation methods in future questions.",
          "Please keep up the good work on your research!",
          "My head is always noisy and I feel uneasy.",
          "I perceive things through different monitors, one for the outside (outer sea) and one for the inside (inner sea) separated by the surface of my body.",
          "However, it takes time to verbalize that, so my speech is about the same speed as other people's.",
          "For those whose inner speech clearly appears as images, for example, when imagining the location of windows in a familiar house, if there are several possibilities that you are unsure about, would the windows move or enlarge/reduce on the scene you are imagining while considering?",
          "After answering, I felt that I mainly think in audio and visual terms.",
          "But that day, maybe I was tired, so I may have put it somewhere else other than the table.",
          "My head is overflowing with inner speech, and I feel like I can't grasp everything.",
          "However, when I need to make a quick decision (e.g., being asked by another customer about the location of a product while I'm serving someone), it's rough images and only my voice.",
          "Personally, it feels like \"all my thoughts appear as text\".",
          "It's more efficient than doing one or the other.",
          "Oh, I need some clothes, too.",
          "Perhaps it's something you only become aware of when you express it externally.",
          "Conversely, I can chew over verbal information from the outside world by reading it aloud in my mind and understanding it non-verbally.",
          "As for textual inner speech, I don't see visual text images or experience auditory sensations; I just recall the text itself (if I had to say, it might be a voice, but it's completely silent, so it's neither my voice nor someone else's).",
          "I can't stop my inner speech by my own will, so to stop it, I read story-based books (novels).",
          "When I think about a presentation script, I imagine myself speaking it in my head, and when I think, \"I did a perfect job!\"",
          "This is an interesting survey, and I find myself becoming self-conscious when I make decisions.",
          "It's close to language, but pre-linguistic.",
          "However, it's not that I'm having a conversation with the imagined listener in my head; rather, I set a scenario where I'm having a conversation, and I'm the only one speaking in that scenario.",
          "Characters slide in from the right edge, and the next character becomes visible.",
          "Also, the speed of my inner speech is the same as my thinking speed, which is much faster than when I actually speak aloud (not constrained by articulation).",
          "Since childhood, I often remember dreams I had during sleep.",
          "It feels like multiple versions of myself are thinking about different things simultaneously.",
          "(When deciding on food, visual and taste sensations are involved.)",
          "While answering this questionnaire and writing this response, my favorite song is playing in my head.",
          "I'm always having a conversation with multiple versions of myself in my head, but when talking to someone else, the text all comes out of my mouth and the other personalities temporarily disappear.",
          "I often think using inner speech that's like a voice, but I don't hear the voice in my head.",
          "It's not strictly thought out as text, and it can be incoherent when verbalized.",
          "I may be entrusting my will, emotions, and actions to manga (e.g., Ajin \"That's what should be done,\" Planetes \"I'll win,\" Ultra Heaven \"Break through the paranoia\").",
          "Thank you.",
          "\"There are people like that?!\"",
          "• I can replay my favorite lines from anime using the voices of my favorite voice actors (even words I've never heard in that voice) as inner speech.",
          "I mostly see dreams in full color, and sometimes a dream's scenery is so beautiful that I ruminate on it after waking up.",
          "However, I'm not sure if it goes as far as inner speech.",
          "If I shake the box with purpose, the pieces arrange themselves into the necessary form.",
          "When I suddenly recall unpleasant images or unwanted memories from the past as images, a specific inner speech emerges.",
          "I think it probably started because I used to sing songs in my head.",
          "Considering various speculations, if I were to list one possibility, it seems most likely that I put it next to the bed in the bedroom.\"",
          "I'm not sure if this is inner speech, but when talking to people, like in this questionnaire, it feels closer to \"imagining\" in visual terms.",
          "I had depersonalization (dissociative disorder) from my teens to my mid-thirties (self-diagnosed).",
          "When an unpleasant song is playing, I try to cancel it out by listening to a different song or consciously trying to remember a different song, but I can't get rid of it and it ends up repeating endlessly.",
          "When I'm driving and see a cat on the roadside, and I start thinking, \"What if that cat was injured...?",
          "During my adolescence, when I frequently watched anime, TV, and movies, a narrator (speaker) often spoke in my head, but that disappeared after I stopped watching them.",
          "This body intensely dislikes having its preferences noticed (I really hate it when someone says, \"Your favorite thing is X, right?",
          "I often organize my thoughts through inner speech, or muttering to myself when no one is around.",
          "I can remember audio if I'm alone, but I can't hear clearly when there's other noise around.",
          "For example, if asked \"What kind of music do you like?\"",
          "Basically, I think to myself entirely in my own voice, but the inner speech that occasionally appears as the voice of another person is often the voice and tone of a character from an anime, manga, or game that I'm currently enjoying.",
          "When it's directed inward, my imagination works more strongly.",
          "I've started noticing, 'Oh, that's not my emotion?'",
          "I can only perceive language as phonetic symbols and diagrams representing meaning, and words and linguistic information do not directly intervene in my brain's primary memory area.",
          "If decisions are made using (a series of) visual representations, can that be called \"thinking\"?",
          "The fact that I think I have a certain grasp on inner speech may be because I write down my thoughts and ideas without organizing them every day.",
          "In particular, I have never thought by replaying other people's voices.",
          "Also, when I'm singing, the next lyrics etc.",
          "My brain only stores organic connections of concepts and data that can be input as \"primary perceptions\" such as images, sounds, and tastes.",
          "The extent to which I use each of my five senses depends on the situation.",
          "Sometimes, other people's conversations appear in my inner speech.",
          "Maybe that's why I'm good at reading but bad at writing, especially business emails.",
          "For example, things like, \"After I finish this, I need to prepare the medicine set for room number so-and-so!",
          "How clear is the visual inner speech as an image?",
          "Specific others (family, friends, mentors, etc.)",
          "Please keep up the good work on your research.",
          "I have been diagnosed with ASD but also have ADHD traits, so my brain is usually hyperactive.",
          "For me, inner speech is just unspoken words, different from thought.",
          "However, they're somewhat linked, so there's no problem if I think including visual, auditory, and gustatory information.",
          "I have a dualistic view of my body.",
          "I often think using a tone I don't normally speak in (for example, a somewhat rough tone like a male protagonist in a shonen manga, even though I wouldn't normally speak that way).",
          "Until I was a university student, when I consciously tried to think about something, it was as if a film had formed over my thoughts, and it was difficult to recognize my inner speech.",
          "Even with English listening, if I try to imagine words and sentences, my head feels overwhelmed, so I interpret the meaning by imagining images (maybe everyone does this) (Incidentally, I unconsciously repeat the spoken English in my mind, but I don't know if this is good or bad in terms of listening skills).",
          "Even difficult problems become easy when broken down into individual solutions.",
          "I think it was when I was regaining consciousness after a traffic accident or when I was very unwell.",
          "I would get into a thought loop wondering if it was inner speech, or my thoughts, or who I was that was thinking these things, which often made me feel sick.",
          "I'm just keeping my eyes open.",
          "It's like a meeting in a conference room, watching a video.",
          "I think I'm the only one with this abnormality, but sometimes my inner thoughts overflow from my head and I react to them (it's just delusion) with my own body.",
          "Conversely, when the target is temporally independent, such as the example of a meal, or when the set of targets is somewhat clear, bulleted text tends to appear.",
          "Sometimes it appears in the form of comic book panels.",
          "I have never seen a psychiatrist.",
          "This doesn't apply to me at all.",
          "I'm not consciously aware of imagining these conversations; (as far as I'm aware) I do it unconsciously.",
          "When I'm tired, negative ones increase.",
          "Even though I'm just going about my daily life, my brain feels unusually tired, and I suspect it's because of this.",
          "My own thoughts and inner monologue are usually unconscious; I'm only focused on the content itself.",
          "When organizing things, for example, I adopt a tone of explanation as if I were explaining to someone, imagining the presence of a listener.",
          "Inner speech imagery feels closest to audio, but it doesn't occur or exist as slowly as normal speech; it often passes by in an instant and is difficult to grasp.",
          "If I don't remember someone's name, their characters don't appear.",
          "There's always some music playing.",
          "When deciding what to eat or buy, I usually imagine myself eating or using it.",
          "I have moderate ASD.",
          "When answering open-ended questions like this, the text is organized in my inner speech, but when I try to input it, I often forget what I was thinking, or when I reread what I've typed, it's not what I wanted to say.",
          "As proof, I can't draw what I imagine neatly on paper.",
          "This often happens when I imagine something completely unrelated to what I'm about to do.",
          "However, while other rich ramen is not necessarily off-limits, the only expression I can think of is, \"I don't want Ramen Jiro ramen.\"",
          "I react to what I see, and words are played back in my brain in my own voice.",
          "Since my brain was damaged by a mental illness, I can no longer visually imagine people or objects!",
          "(searching for the feeling) and, based on my awareness of, 'Well, I don't really want to do it,' I'm able to make a judgment.",
          "Since textual information can also be \"delicious,\" I think I rely on phantom taste sensations in my judgment.",
          "I'm not good at writing, but maybe people who are good at writing have developed soliloquies-like inner speech.",
          "It's mostly self-talk with simultaneous images as needed.",
          "I think I often handle matters concerning my own preferences alone, but handle high-risk matters through brain meetings.",
          "As inner speech not included in the choices, I have a background music (songs with lyrics) that is unrelated to the content of my thoughts playing in my head.",
          "A conversation between characters is replayed in my mind.",
          "It's greatly influenced by the situation, physical condition, and mood.",
          "When I imagine words or sentences, I mainly imagine abstract sounds and resonance, but I don't imagine a voice, so I don't really think of it as auditory.",
          "I'd also like to see the minds of multilingual speakers.",
          "In short, it's a grand one-man show.",
          "This text is my inner speech as it is, and I probably couldn't write it with a pencil.",
          "I don't think I can create clear images in my head.",
          "Thinking about it more, flowcharts can probably be divided into image flowcharts and text-based flowcharts.",

          "It's similar to talking to myself.",
          "Regarding how clearly I can perceive my own inner speech, my auditory perception is clear, but my visual perception is somewhat blurry, so there's a difference in sensation.",
          "The voice is less my voice and more a voice I unconsciously emit, and my actual way of speaking and voice are strongly influenced by my inner speech.",
          "Since I'm the type to hear my own voice, I thought everyone did it naturally.",
          "However, I feel that inner speech where I translate words into images is rare.",

          "Does my spoken language come out first?",
          "As a characteristic of my inner speech, I considered that it sometimes uses my own words, sometimes images, and sometimes a combination, depending on the content and situation of my thinking.",
          "I feel that in social situations my inner speech is more visually oriented, but when alone I often think out loud, speaking to myself.",

          "(b) Also, when thinking about situations involving people, I simulate conversations between the people involved.",
          "For the same reason, it's difficult to choose the option where I'm having a conversation with someone else.",
          "It's not much different from when I'm speaking aloud.",

          "Maybe it's because I have ADHD, but I always have an inner monologue, and it's often tiring.",
          "I have schizophrenia and experience autoscopic vision, spontaneous memory recall, and spontaneous inner speech in my brain.",
          "A lot of words come to mind in my own voice, like unspoken mumbling.",

          "My inner speech all comes from me, but I can't control it.",
          "Learning about the concept of inner speech for the first time and then strongly focusing on the voice I hear from within myself while answering was a strange experience.",
          "I believe this form was investigating how inner speech emerges in the process of formulating responses to questions and suggestions from others, but I think inner speech manifests differently when I'm introspecting alone.",
          "This questionnaire made me aware of the ambiguous boundary between conscious and unconscious inner speech.",
          "It's similar to silent reading.",
          "I'm not sure if this is called inner monologue, but when I read something, it's replayed in my head in the other person's voice.",

          "I think it's this abstract sensation that allows for moments of insight, and it feels like it processes information faster than concrete images.",
          "However, vividly recreating the image content and trying to extract information from it is tiring, so I often proceed with a rough, vague image if it's not a problem.",
          "Images are basically displayed as single frames, and when I imagine something moving, the images switch like a stop-motion animation.",
          "• When reading, I hear the characters' voices in my head.",

          "Lighter things like meals are images, while expensive things like cars feel like I think about them with flowcharts or text.",
          "From childhood, I have been thinking using abstract images and the 3-4 dimensional space where those images are located instead of words.",
          "When thinking, my head is dark, and the necessary images appear in color, with text flowing in the margins (the dark areas), accompanied by my voice in a monologue.",

          "When writing novels, I replay images in my head and then put them into words.",
          "When I want to avoid overthinking, I imagine \"thoughts\" as text (like reading something in a book), or I visualize the words that appear in my thoughts as Mincho-type characters (like lyrics popping up one by one in a lyric video), slowing down my thinking speed.",

          "During my student days, after reading a textbook for studying, when a question about it came up on the exam, I would recall a visual memory of that part of the textbook, zooming in like focusing a camera.",

          "If I hear 'wallet,' I immediately see an image of myself opening my bag.",

          "Also, when I remember or reflect on something, I often replay the actual actions.",
          "Thinking in images or flowcharts is something I can do \"if I try,\" but I don't actively use them.",
          "It also differs when I write a novel versus when I read someone else's novel.",
          "The key points are in my head, but the text itself is formed as I write it.",
          "When I'm writing or reading, it also feels like it's in my head as a voice.",
          "As an addition, flowcharts also appear as videos (or still images).",
          "I feel like I'm thinking in my own voice while imagining images, and although it's in sentences, I don't imagine the sentences themselves.",
          "It feels like the higher-level (overviewer) self is preparing the images for judgment.",
          "When speed-reading a book, watching a video, or listening to music, I focus on this image when my own voice becomes a hindrance.",
          "Basically, I think in images, and I can determine the content as I wish,\nbut only when shopping do I hear my wife's approval or indirect disapproval before the image appears.",
          "Sometimes, I try to recall things by having colors appear in my head due to synesthesia.",
          "I can see images, but they're still images, not movies.",
          "I think I am thinking while supplementing the general image (atmosphere) with words.",
          "Therefore, even within the same work, I feel that there are characters that 'sound' like ① and characters that 'don't sound' like ③.",
          "Since I think so much just to write with a pen, even when I'm talking to a friend in a cafe and see someone next to me writing with a pen, I feel like a part of my brain, aside from the part used for the conversation, is registering the feeling of writing, remembering the smell of ink, or picturing the written paper.",
          "Usually, I feel like my thoughts are replaying in my head as images and a voice (that I believe is my own).",
          "I often think without using words, or with abstract images without accompanying visuals.",
          "I'm a designer, and my strong visual memory and thinking might be related to my profession.",

          "This is mainly in the form of sound, but through this situation, I've come to realize that elements other than sound, such as visuals, come into play when making decisions, making this a fascinating survey for me.",
          "When the content I want to output is not completely determined (when the novel's text is not complete in my inner speech), an animation is played in my head, and my thinking converts it into language and writes it.",
          "I think I often have a thought process where my voice comments on and organizes multiple fragmented images.",
          "But since I think in concepts, I can think much faster than using other ways of thinking, and I reach most conclusions in about the time it takes to blink once.",
          "In the previous question, when \"looking for my wallet\" or \"deciding on a meal,\" I had visual imagery related to those actions.",
          "My thoughts are only in my own voice, but when I read, I do so in my head in the voice of a suitable voice actor, and the scene plays out as a drama-like visual (I automatically create visuals in my head and cast actors).",
          "I write novels and research typing.",
          "But in all cases, vision is the strongest.",
          "My way of remembering things is photographic (sometimes video), so I wonder if that has some influence.",
          "I'm visually dominant, so I easily take in visual information, organize it visually, and can easily express it visually.",
          "When imagining something concrete, an image appears first, and I often talk about that image in my head.",
          "While I answered with text and images, I have more abstract things in my head.",
          "When I'm writing a novel, a finished text already exists in my head, and my voice reads it aloud, and my thinking writes it in a way that mimics it.",
          "I realized for the first time that I have a habit of thinking about completely unrelated things associated with a \"word\".",
          "When I imagine an object, it's often in a clear photograph state, but when I think, I imagine a more abstract image.",
          "In the case of things with substance, not concepts, visual images may be included.",
          "Overall, I seem to tend to think using things like concepts, not things that actually exist in reality, such as letters and images.",
          "With four people, I move my eyes up, down, left, and right, focusing on each person.",
          "When I recall information, I often recall it by the atmosphere of the characters, so I feel that my visual sense is very strong.",
          "When my thoughts are scattered or I get emotional, I feel like I can get an objective perspective by speaking or writing them down.",
          "When eating, it was imagery, but when considering the advantages of buying a car, etc., what came to mind wasn't imagery but two versions of myself engaging in self-questioning.",
          "I narrow down the options from the images that catch my eye, and then choose them like a flowchart, checking against the conditions while listening to the explanations.",
          "Since elementary school, I've been writing novels, and I often imagine things visually.",
          "It's slightly different from images or flowcharts; it's somewhat like a graph, but I don't have much visual imagery.",
          "When thinking (remembering) based on memory, it's visually oriented, and it's less like a normal flat display and more like my own raw sensation (maybe like a 360-degree camera or a polar coordinate-like spatial recognition).",
          "So I created a unique kana arrangement, \"Naginata-shiki,\" and use it daily for writing.",
          "When it comes to sentences, I think of them as a type of image or as a coherent unit of meaning.",
          "For concrete thinking, I imagine photos and illustrations while comparing them.",
          "Rewinding the images is also rather difficult.",
          "I used to think I was 'thinking in writing,' but on reflection, it's more like 'thinking while adding images to the writing and reading it aloud in my head in my own voice.'",
          "As a child, I think I relied heavily on this sense of direction for memory (like when recalling a picture book, I would mentally reach for it on the second shelf from the left, then turn the pages left).",
          "For shapes, I see images; when I'm thinking about my future actions, I think in voice.",
          "While looking at an image, I often take action based on conclusions reached through a dialogue with another personality.",
          "Rather than having characters or images flow through my head, it's more like a box containing all the options and flow of conversation pops up in my brain at that moment.",
          "For abstract thinking, I think as if I'm mentally taking notes in spoken language.",
          "When a concrete image is needed, like looking for something, it's with visuals and audio; otherwise, only audio is played.",
          "Like flash calculation or music heard from a passing car, an image appears for a moment, and I later try to consciously construct words based on that memory, like explaining it to someone else, but I've never succeeded.",
          "When I'm thinking about various things, images, visuals, and text all go through my head simultaneously, not just sounds.",
          "in images.",
          "I basically think in my own voice, but when I'm drawing as a hobby, I imagine it visually, like taking a picture.",
          "If I had to describe it, it's like picturing multiple Wikipedia articles with links included.",
          "Conversely, when I'm trying to remember where I put something, if I can't recall the image of putting it down, I use words to describe the situation; if I can retrace the scene, I use visual imagery.",
          "I think there are connections between images and concepts in my head, but it's not in the form of clear images or flowcharts.",
          "Sometimes I re-experience the smell or texture.",
          "I don't remember clearly, but I felt like I was thinking in colors.",
          "When creating three-dimensional objects, I rotate and unfold the completed image in my head.",
          "), there are various concepts in an imaginary space, and I grab them, move through that space to a certain situation (with visual and bodily sensations at that time)...that's how I feel.",
          "When I recall people or memories, I sometimes imagine them in color.",
          "Hues can be thought of in terms of physical laws, and humans can think of them like \"something like this\" even without knowledge in the form of words, so this is a kind of measuring tool or rule mentioned earlier, and it's visual.",
          "So, I think the \"misinterpretations\" that occur when novels are made into live-action films might be due to this.",
          "At that time, I also see an image of the other person from my perspective.",
          "Other examples include figuring out where I am on a map by matching a bird's-eye view I create in my head from the surrounding scenery with the map, or visually imagining the dependencies between codes when writing programs.",
          "Basically, I always think with images, but sometimes I feel like images and flowcharts are combined.",
          "It's close to video, but it's more like a series of still images switching, a kind of flip-book animation.",
          "When I'm seriously thinking, it's visuals; when I'm zoning out, it's my own voice; when I'm thinking of email text, it's my voice and bullet points; when I read a book, it's other people's voices and visuals—it changes depending on the situation.",
          "Even now, as I'm writing this, my voice is reading aloud a complete text in my head, and my thoughts are commanding my hand to type it on the keyboard.",
          "For example, by putting it into words or drawing a picture.",
          "The other day, when thinking about where a passing car was going, my friend said it was in text, while I said it was like looking at a game map from a bird's-eye view.",
          "When recalling something, it's sometimes just an image, like a sound or shape, but when making a decision, I usually feel like I'm talking to myself in my head.",
          "Basically, when I think about something, a part of a sentence, such as a conjunction, plays back in my head at super high speed in my own voice, and then an image comes to mind.",
          "I imagine things from scratch as images, so I realized I'm definitely visually dominant.",
          "When I objectively consider my situation, several of my own voices (thinking pattern A, pattern B, etc., each a different perspective... usually about three patterns) overlap on the image.",
          "I think in concepts.",
          "It calms down while I'm reading.",
          "Characters and abstract symbols are difficult to materialize as images without the aid of external memory.",
          "Even with the still images, if I try to look closely at the details, they seem to disappear.",
          "I'm good at mixing colors, seasoning, and rough estimations—non-verbal processing.",
          "(→I remember it with images)...etc.",
          "I think I only use images when doing operations that are difficult to verbalize, such as imagining whether a dish I made will fit in this container or thinking about a route in my head.",
          "The image is visual, but it doesn't appear like a real scene in front of my eyes.",
          "Before taking it, I felt like thoughts and visual images in my own voice were flowing endlessly in my head regardless of my will, but now I don't think much comes to mind unless I consciously choose to \"think,\" and I feel like I don't get visual images as much.",
          "At the moment of pop-up, I understand the gist of the contents myself, and when outputting conversation etc., I have the feeling of drawing from it.",
          "I often think using audio and text as if I were on a TV program or writing/publishing a book (although I haven't actually done either).",
          "Memories are images.",
          "Sometimes I think visually and then translate that image into words, while other times it's only images or only words.",
          "I feel colors, gradations, parts of landscapes, brightness, and darkness.",
          "(Even when writing and rereading this, I'm saying all the characters in my head, though not out loud.)",
          "Even though I say images, I think in terms of concepts or clusters of images.",
          "It's like I talk to myself in my head, and if necessary, images appear as well.",
          "Also, I remember that visual images were completely dominant when I was a child, but as I got older, verbalization in my brain became much stronger.",
          "I sometimes spatially arrange memories and concepts and connect them.",
          "I think about places and objects in images.",
          "Sometimes, images or videos, visual images float in my head, but the images themselves are blurry, and I can't see them clearly most of the time.",
          "I often think in several patterns; I think in both visuals and audio.",
          "It often doesn't affect decision-making, but when I read distinctive books (like Natsume Soseki's I Am a Cat, and Tsutomu Nihei's The Void Hypothesis), their writing style sometimes transfers to how I speak in my head.",
          "When recalling, it's a replayed image;\nwhen deciding, it's my own voice;\nwhen choosing from options, it's first like a bulleted list of images (images and videos are pasted onto a neatly arranged row in my mind, and when I focus on an image/video, I hear a voice-over-like explanation).",
          "As I've written elsewhere, I strongly visualize my thinking as 'ripples on the surface of the water in my head, with associations forming from the strongest ripples'.",
          "I sometimes confront my own emotions by piecing together and replaying various scenes and lines from shows I've seen in my brain (like a commentary on an erotic video game).",
          "In situations without tools for external memory, it's close to the feeling of being in a first-person perspective like an FPS, narrating my own thoughts aloud.",
          "I often think by visualizing images and pictures in my head, adding my own voice while doing so.",
