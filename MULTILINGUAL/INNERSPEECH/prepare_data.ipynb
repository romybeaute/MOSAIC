      "- My first experience that would fit your description of \"consciousness of consciousness\" occurred at a very young age.\n",
      "- Due to the death of my mother (when I was seven years old), I, as a primary school student, spent long afternoons and weekends with thoughts and questions about the meaning of life.\n",
      "- One day, the following question arose in my mind: \"Who actually asked that?\n",
      "- Who is thinking here?\n",
      "- Who am I?\"\n",
      "- At that moment, I felt for the first time that I am not my thoughts, but the invisible thinker.\n",
      "- I felt like a lonely spectator in an empty cinema who suddenly realized that he is not the main actor in the film he is watching.\n",
      "- At 16, I came into contact with Zen.\n",
      "- Initially skeptical, I declared that I had no interest in meditation.\n",
      "- Nevertheless, my teacher persuaded me to try it at least once.\n",
      "- This led to 35 years of practice.\n",
      "- My first experience was that I not only have a body (like a tool), but in a certain way I am this body.\n",
      "- If my posture changes, my world changes.\n",
      "- This experience was surprising insofar as I had almost disassociated myself from my body (the main actor in the film) (\"That's not me at all!\").\n",
      "- After a year of almost daily meditation, I participated in my first sesshin, later (after studying Japanese studies) I became a monk in a Zen monastery in Japan.\n",
      "- Each meditation means a different experience.\n",
      "- Important for me were experiences in which I felt I was reaching an inner (and also outer, physical) limit.\n",
      "- When I then believed that this would kill me, and yet completely surrendered to it (\"Let the other monks bury me here tonight!\n",
      "- \"), everything became very simple.\n",
      "- It went by itself.\n",
      "- However, I also believe that I and perhaps most other people can claim that even in their normal state they are not only conscious, but also conscious of their consciousness.\n",
      "- Rather, it is probably an exception (at least in my case) if I am only conscious without this consciousness being accompanied by a witness.\n",
      "- Therefore, I have mostly understood my Zen practice as not focusing my attention on the inner observer (the lonely spectator in the cinema), but forgetting the seat in the cinema and instead re-identifying myself with the actor on the screen and the ever-unfinished script.\n",

      "- 1.\n",
      "- One night, before falling asleep, my mind being focused on something completely different, with a massive shock, something happened inside me.\n",
      "- My thinking stopped, stood still, and everything disappeared for a short moment from my mind.\n",
      "- I felt elevated to a higher plane, where in peace I could witness emptiness of the mind.\n",
      "- Floating in Cosmos must feel a bit like this.\n",
      "- The insight crystallized, that of course there was no certainty, no first law, or last principle, or final system, from which the world as it is can be described and explained.\n",
      "- It didn't exist.\n",
      "- It is only an expectation of the mind, which naturally looks for certainty, order and system.\n",
      "- Or if your mind doesn't look for it, it assumes that these things exist anyway, hidden somewhere.\n",
      "- 2.\n",
      "- Two-dimensional designs developed complex, colorful and animated depth.\n",
      "- The beauty became overwhelming, I understood that such beauty was not of this world, could never be seen in this world by anyone.\n",
      "- Not being religious, I was paralyzed and in awe.\n",
      "- I felt on the edge of something.\n",
      "- Then the chronology becomes diffuse.\n",
      "- I may not be able to tell the events in their proper order, or perhaps the order as such did not exist at the time in the place where my mind was.\n",
      "- I attained a state where I felt I could ask any question, or rather face any question, and I would find the answer, within me.\n",
      "- I faced the question related to the girl I had loved and deified and that had left me, without giving a proper explanation.\n",
      "- The knot was resolved immediately, and the suffering inside me related to her unintelligible loss stopped, not just then but forever; I finally found myself accepting, forgiving, letting go.\n",
      "- This was only the preface, however important that question had been for me.\n",
      "- Then I faced the question about the last law and principle, the question about the origin of things and whether there was a primal order, a meaning in the world as it is, the question that had never left me after my small revelation that it was not to be answered by thinking alone.\n",
