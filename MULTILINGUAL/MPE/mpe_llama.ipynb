      "My first experience that would fit your description of \"consciousness of consciousness\" occurred at a very young age. Due to the death of my mother (when I was seven years old), I, as a primary school student, spent long afternoons and weekends with thoughts and questions about the meaning of life. One day, the following question arose in my mind: \"Who actually asked that? Who is thinking here? Who am I?\" At that moment, I felt for the first time that I am not my thoughts, but the invisible thinker. I felt like a lonely spectator in an empty cinema who suddenly realized that he is not the main actor in the film he is watching. At 16, I came into contact with Zen. Initially skeptical, I declared that I had no interest in meditation. Nevertheless, my teacher persuaded me to try it at least once. This led to 35 years of practice. My first experience was that I not only have a body (like a tool), but in a certain way I am this body. If my posture changes, my world changes. This experience was surprising insofar as I had almost disassociated myself from my body (the main actor in the film) (\"That's not me at all!\"). After a year of almost daily meditation, I participated in my first sesshin, later (after studying Japanese studies) I became a monk in a Zen monastery in Japan. Each meditation means a different experience. Important for me were experiences in which I felt I was reaching an inner (and also outer, physical) limit. When I then believed that this would kill me, and yet completely surrendered to it (\"Let the other monks bury me here tonight!\"), everything became very simple. It went by itself. However, I also believe that I and perhaps most other people can claim that even in their normal state they are not only conscious, but also conscious of their consciousness. Rather, it is probably an exception (at least in my case) if I am only conscious without this consciousness being accompanied by a witness. Therefore, I have mostly understood my Zen practice as not focusing my attention on the inner observer (the lonely spectator in the cinema), but forgetting the seat in the cinema and instead re-identifying myself with the actor on the screen and the ever-unfinished script.\n",

      "1. One night, before falling asleep, my mind being focused on something completely different, with a massive shock, something happened inside me. My thinking stopped, stood still, and everything disappeared for a short moment from my mind. I felt elevated to a higher plane, where in peace I could witness emptiness of the mind. Floating in Cosmos must feel a bit like this. The insight crystallized, that of course there was no certainty, no first law, or last principle, or final system, from which the world as it is can be described and explained. It didn't exist. It is only an expectation of the mind, which naturally looks for certainty, order and system. Or if your mind doesn't look for it, it assumes that these things exist anyway, hidden somewhere.  2. Two-dimensional designs developed complex, colorful and animated depth. The beauty became overwhelming, I understood that such beauty was not of this world, could never be seen in this world by anyone. Not being religious, I was paralyzed and in awe. I felt on the edge of something. Then the chronology becomes diffuse. I may not be able to tell the events in their proper order, or perhaps the order as such did not exist at the time in the place where my mind was. I attained a state where I felt I could ask any question, or rather face any question, and I would find the answer, within me. I faced the question related to the girl I had loved and deified and that had left me, without giving a proper explanation. The knot was resolved immediately, and the suffering inside me related to her unintelligible loss stopped, not just then but forever; I finally found myself accepting, forgiving, letting go. This was only the preface, however important that question had been for me. Then I faced the question about the last law and principle, the question about the origin of things and whether there was a primal order, a meaning in the world as it is, the question that had never left me after my small revelation that it was not to be answered by thinking alone. I cannot render the question more precisely, but I consciously found myself facing the reason for my quest for the ultimate truth. The answer was given. What happened subsequently is beyond words, and any attempt to render it directly or indirectly risks being misleading, banal, and is certainly inadequate, incomplete, contradictory. The beauty and glory was immense and awesome beyond any description. I realized, knew beyond doubt, that what I was experiencing was the grace of direct knowledge of the essence of things, and I realized how blind I had been, how I had been looking the wrong way, overlooking the most obvious, not seeing what was directly in front of me, waiting to be discovered, so obvious, but I had always overlooked it. It was an experience affecting directly all senses and the mind at the same time, with enormous force. While I was witnessing this I was crying, of joy, of humility, of thankfulness, of shame for not having realized this truth before, of having been inattentive to the most important. Part of my mind was able to maintain a minimum of attention to the physical world around me, and I kept saying \"how could I not notice, how could I, me, not realize...\" This revelation can be narrated as having a beginning, a middle, and an end, but in essence, it escapes chronological ordering. At the beginning this absolute, immense, beautiful entity appeared, which occupied all my senses, more beautiful than imaginable or ever experienced, or even thought possible in an abstract way. It was a borderless and bright source of light, emanating forms and colors, sounds and smells and touch, within and transcending infinite space and time, like an exploding star in the cold space of the universe. And I still somehow existed, as a witness, as a receiver of grace. The world of the divine was opened to me, shifting the real world to a more relative plane. It became clear to me, and it was as if a play was played to me to illustrate this, that my life on earth was just a temporary creation, or a game, that all my encounters with other people, with everything, were arranged for me, as situations, but that myself, and all these encountered, were now lifted away, and it was revealed, that there were but creatures, who had been put there to play a role, as characters in a play, who collapse back into the actors they really are, when the show is over, and go back behind the scene to rest, like puppets. I think there were voices, and beings without number or permanent shape, which were also emanations of the great source of all this, but this is a very inaccurate description. I felt a realization of all things I had done, by perceiving objectively the effect of my actions on others as if I had affected not them, but myself, both in terms of the good and the bad I had done. I relived my life, or what was important in it, but all at once, without a linear or chronological order, I relived everything as if objectively, morally, by clearly realizing the value of everything I had done, feeling the sensations of others, from the position of those or that which was receiving good and bad from me. I felt utter remorse, repentance and helplessness, at realizing the bad I had done, and felt despair. Then I was forgiven. In this process, I started to disappear, to dissolve as a separate being and to go back into and unite with whom was showing me himself and all.\n",

My thinking stopped, stood still, and everything disappeared for a short moment from my mind. I felt elevated to a higher plane, where in peace I could witness emptiness of the mind. Floating in Cosmos must feel a bit like this. The insight crystallized, that of course there was no certainty, no first law, or last principle, or final system, from which the world as it is can be described and explained. It didn't exist. It is only an expectation of the mind, which naturally looks for certainty, order and system. Or if your mind doesn't look for it, it assumes that these things exist anyway, hidden somewhere.  2. Two-dimensional designs developed complex, colorful and animated depth. The beauty became overwhelming, I understood that such beauty was not of this world, could never be seen in this world by anyone. Not being religious, I was paralyzed and in awe. I felt on the edge of something. Then the chronology becomes diffuse. I may not be able to tell the events in their proper order, or perhaps the order as such did not exist at the time in the place where my mind was. I attained a state where I felt I could ask any question, or rather face any question, and I would find the answer, within me. I faced the question related to the girl I had loved and deified and that had left me, without giving a proper explanation. The knot was resolved immediately, and the suffering inside me related to her unintelligible loss stopped, not just then but forever; I finally found myself accepting, forgiving, letting go. This was only the preface, however important that question had been for me. Then I faced the question about the last law and principle, the question about the origin of things and whether there was a primal order, a meaning in the world as it is, the question that had never left me after my small revelation that it was not to be answered by thinking alone. I cannot render the question more precisely, but I consciously found myself facing the reason for my quest for the ultimate truth. The answer was given. What happened subsequently is beyond words, and any attempt to render it directly or indirectly risks being misleading, banal, and is certainly inadequate, incomplete, contradictory. The beauty and glory was immense and awesome beyond any description. I realized, knew beyond doubt, that what I was experiencing was the grace of direct knowledge of the essence of things, and I realized how blind I had been, how I had been looking the wrong way, overlooking the most obvious, not seeing what was directly in front of me, waiting to be discovered, so obvious, but I had always overlooked it. It was an experience affecting directly all senses and the mind at the same time, with enormous force. While I was witnessing this I was crying, of joy, of humility, of thankfulness, of shame for not having realized this truth before, of having been inattentive to the most important. Part of my mind was able to maintain a minimum of attention to the physical world around me, and I kept saying \"how could I not notice, how could I, me, not realize...\" This revelation can be narrated as having a beginning, a middle, and an end, but in essence, it escapes chronological ordering. At the beginning this absolute, immense, beautiful entity appeared, which occupied all my senses, more beautiful than imaginable or ever experienced, or even thought possible in an abstract way. It was a borderless and bright source of light, emanating forms and colors, sounds and smells and touch, within and transcending infinite space and time, like an exploding star in the cold space of the universe. And I still somehow existed, as a witness, as a receiver of grace. The world of the divine was opened to me, shifting the real world to a more relative plane. It became clear to me, and it was as if a play was played to me to illustrate this, that my life on earth was just a temporary creation, or a game, that all my encounters with other people, with everything, were arranged for me, as situations, but that myself, and all these encountered, were now lifted away, and it was revealed, that there were but creatures, who had been put there to play a role, as characters in a play, who collapse back into the actors they really are, when the show is over, and go back behind the scene to rest, like puppets. I think there were voices, and beings without number or permanent shape, which were also emanations of the great source of all this, but this is a very inaccurate description. I felt a realization of all things I had done, by perceiving objectively the effect of my actions on others as if I had affected not them, but myself, both in terms of the good and the bad I had done. I relived my life, or what was important in it, but all at once, without a linear or chronological order, I relived everything as if objectively, morally, by clearly realizing the value of everything I had done, feeling the sensations of others, from the position of those or that which was receiving good and bad from me. I felt utter remorse, repentance and helplessness, at realizing the bad I had done, and felt despair. Then I was forgiven. In this process, I started to disappear, to dissolve as a separate being and to go back into and unite with whom was showing me himself and all.\n",

      "My experience of consciousness occurred during meditation; suddenly I felt as if my body was dissolving and becoming something like energy. There were no limits, and it merged with the cushion on which I was sitting and extended throughout the room. I was fully conscious and amazed by what was happening. Everything seemed to originate in my hands; from there, this sensation grew. Everything was silent, and there was a lot of light. Presence of the here and now.\n",

      "I experienced pure awareness during a meditation session. Before I meditated, I was in a depressive state, filled with great sadness and heaviness. During meditation, I entered a bright (non-visual) mental weightlessness that was boundless and yet offered a non-tactile/non-visual space of security. The sadness and burden of my soul had completely disappeared and no longer played a role. All concepts were lifted, and I experienced pure being in harmony with everything. After the meditation, my emotional state was still depressive, but filled with the certainty of being able to free myself from it at any time for moments that seemed timeless. I felt free and carefree, completely aware of myself.\n",

      "In winter, during my long, full-time Zen meditation practice in a temple, after 6 months of meditation (my first time ever), I sat in front of a glass door and was seeing the corridor outside the doors. It was my first experience of \"awareness\" in meditation. That day was the middle of a 5-day concentrated sitting period (14 hours per day); the corridor shone brightly in the sunlight. I had been just watching the corridor without any thought. And suddenly I noticed that I felt there was no glass door separating me and the corridor, and even my body. There was only the shine reflected on the wood in the corridor, feeling (I) no longer had a border to the world, and neither did the world.\n",

          "I have a body.",
          "It was as if everything disappeared, body, mind, space and time, but awareness itself was still present.",
          "When it was my turn, I didn't know what to say; what I had found was something so different from other experiences that it seemingly didn't fit here.",
          "I am here.",
          "Deeper states require more practice.",
          "I was everything and nothing.",
          "Characteristic for me is the extreme lightness of the state, awareness appears like a barely perceptible breath, that I could easily overlook it.",
          "There was no 'I' anymore, there was, for example, nobody who had feelings, but feelings appeared and disappeared.",
          "Slight cloudiness of this bliss: On the last three of the ten days it is so still and thought-free in me that it worries me in phases.",
          "Perhaps the words \"clarity\", \"simplicity\", and \"openness\" best describe my state.",
          "It was a heavy and yet somehow weightless state while sitting.",
          "I tried not to cling to any thoughts, perceptions, or emotions.",
          "Visual impressions with open eyes are then more distant, like a picture, and with closed eyes it seems brighter to me than before, regardless of the existing light sources.",
          "Normally I feel as if I'm behind my eyes, in my head.",
          "All appeared realistic under scrutiny.",

          "The shift in perspective is subtle yet substantial.",
          "I regularly practice Dzogchen and can find the natural state relatively easily.",
          "There is neither boundary nor separation.",
          "Somehow always - even if only little in the formal, strict way.",
          "Negative: Sleep-deprived and not meditating, after reading about non-dual consciousness, I felt immediacy of experience.",
          "Desires and doubts were experienced as pain as soon as they were born.",

          "The door is ajar and behind it is a dazzling light shining through the gap.",
          "I don't experience the body as a flowing river of sensations, but I experience *experience* as a flowing river of experience, more or less broad—encompassing anything from a vast swath or a hyper-focused pinprick of present arising.",
          "I was grateful for this experience.",
          "Everything outside seemed far, far away and could not affect my state of \"pure being.\"",
          "It is like sitting on a large beanbag or throne; the body sits on this throne of a sphere of light, and one (whatever perceives there) looks out.",
          "Two states of consciousness seem to run concurrently: the STILLNESS (pure awareness), the basis of all being, always present, and the processes in the world of form, no longer experienced as different from the STILLNESS.",

          "This is the source of all experiences.",

          "After this event, nothing was ever the same.",
          "Everything felt irrelevant.",

          "How is this not unity when there is no two?",
          "All thoughts, inner and outer, were like a reflection; there was only Being, self-recognizing awareness.",
          "When activity ceases, as in meditation, this state shines through.",
          "I was at the same time very receptive and not receptive at all.",
          "It happened that at one point during formal practice, I entered or became an infinite, timeless space, and I was no longer identified with my thoughts and emotions.",
          "I think it's mostly because it's generally believed to be so difficult to achieve.",
          "I felt as if I were in an empty room from which I could decide what I wanted to look at next.",
          "In Zazen, coping better with the fear of death, in the sense that I experience myself in a state of detachment.",
          "My first overwhelming experience of peace, happiness, and oneness was at 23, though I never dared talk about it until later.",
          "I understood my true essence.",
          "A very strong feeling of connection with something I recognized.",
          "Everything is the same.",
          "Occasionally occurred during meditation, in complete wakefulness, an experience of boundlessness, yet physical, floating, yet dense, bright, open, without thoughts.",
          "But all that is happening in presence.",
          "During a meditation, a white light spread from the crown of my head over my entire body.",
          "Only so far with a slight touch of concern.",

          "While meditating - very simple breath observation - resting meditation - the breath deepens and it feels as if it happens on its own and my whole body would immerse itself in the breathing movement, body boundaries dissolve warm-pulsatingly ... at some point only the perception of \"breath happens in space\", no I who perceives, but an impression of \"there are impersonal eyes in the space\".",

          "Finally, someone is researching this, for me it will hardly be any surprises.",
          "It has a quality of infinity to it like a torus rotating around its central circle.",
          "But actually nothing was there that perceived it.",
          "I would best describe the states with the words wakefulness, clarity, liveliness, brightness (metaphorically, not as an actual light sensation), they have a vibrating quality (again metaphorically, not tactile) and are very intense.",

          "But instead of relief, I felt immense dread.",
          "I had an experience of pure experience in which I became aware of myself.",

          "But from there, where Everything is in Nothing, I cannot bring Nothing into Everything.",
          "Because after some time, there is a feeling of increasing expansion, not only of consciousness, but also of the body.",
          "I notice details that I wouldn't before, like how sounds are made of many separate layers of sounds, or the parallax effect of the relationship between the movement of closer and farther objects (if I'm walking).",

          "PA is body consciousness.",
          "I began to feel extreme comfort in my whole body (nothing hurt anymore, and I didn't feel the limits of my body either), all the sensations were pleasant (the temperature of the environment and my body were harmonized, the sounds were distant and soft) and I began to feel that I was one with the whole.",
          "The sensations in this experience are quite different and range from 'having no sensation', to the feeling of disembodiment or 'not being bound to the body', or even 'being inside and outside at the same time', to the simple impression that existence is enough.",

          "Feelings: harmony, joy, laughter.",
          "That was like an inner death, but then also a greater freedom than pure consciousness itself.",
          "In the following sitting meditation (the whole thing happened during a retreat) the experience deepened, occasionally interrupted by images/fantasies such as worms wriggling through me (since I was just earth), and the question again whether I agreed to this state of being.",
          "I am stunned.",
          "1) experience from a lucid dream (what I was thinking of when filling out this questionnaire) I was having a lucid dream.",

          "The only similar experience was after ingesting magic mushrooms.",
          "Afterwards, of course, I read a lot about it and classify the whole thing as a spiritual crisis that, continuously weakening, lasted about 7 years.",
          "This experience has changed everything in my life, and I am now trying to find the most effective and beneficial way of helping others with this knowledge.",

          "The space between thoughts expands - to a free space within me.",

          "The last four days - happiness, even without a kick: More and more often and longer and longer I get into the thought-free free space.",
          "I experienced myself as a collection of sensations and behavior patterns that, while normally occupying 100% of my awareness, suddenly were about 0.00000000000001% of my conscious experience.",

          "It has always been like this.",
          "That was the moment when I experienced pure awareness, and I realize that when all this happened, it was as if there had been an emptiness of everything, as if every concept of time had disappeared, as if I had witnessed the crumbling and decomposition of what my mental senses were perceiving until I could no longer think or imagine, until there was no more without needing to be.",
          "It was constant and it didn't need any form of human expression.",
          "If I then let myself fall into it and 'go through', I come into a total feeling of weightlessness, emptiness, awareness.",
          "A huge gift from the innermost depths of my being.",

          "You're finally experiencing all of it, all of the universe you can experience in that given time... so it's full.",
          "The relaxation is very deep, so deep that even inner verbalization/dialoguing stops.",
          "As if suddenly gravity was removed, but rather than it being shocking and the mind going wild, a calm approach.",
          "Likewise that of the world.",
          "I acted as if in a dream state; there was also no feeling of time or I; I simply had the completely neutral intention of protecting the child without any emotion or thought...",
          "Then it becomes still again.",
          "This was 7 months ago but still stands as a high point of experience.",

          "I can't describe it any better and it's a recurring experience.",
          "Of course, the hormones do their bit, but the growing 'foreign' life in one's own body is a miracle in itself, and in this case, the woman is the miracle herself.",
          "Effortlessly, in a way I've never experienced before.",
          "Especially with the TM experience, I felt the TM space as rather gloomy afterwards, although the bright lamp was switched on.",
          "Like the whole universe was brimming with vibrant life which was the same as me.",
          "Emotions came and went without identification; they were content, not part of the 'I'.",
          "I had an eternity experience; my breath would rise and fall endlessly, echoing with the movement within itself, and at the same time only be present in the present moment.",

          "I was a student and had previously failed two math exams.",
          "Meditation in the style of Za-Zen, completely permeable without demarcation from the surroundings, high vigilance, joy and happiness.",
          "About the experience, so I was in the supermarket, and I was worrying about spending too much money and suddenly my awareness opened up and I didn't feel my body anymore and there was lightness, it was like something opened up in my chest and dissolved \"me\" and awareness was just floating there, soon awe came and contentment.",
          "Insight: a poem.",
          "I repeatedly experience the connection with myself, the people around me, the world and the universe and again with myself.",
          "Ultimately, the state is nothing special; it is essentially a dwelling in the state of pre-cognitive perception, in which the mind does not yet elaborate concrete contents, unless I allow this to happen intentionally.",

          "The absorption described earlier has a different quality.",
          "Despite its brevity, the experience felt profound.",
          "Today something - poking it.",

          "Never experienced it again with that intensity.",
          "So there was an aspect of inner brightness there along with the consciousness of being in silent, pure consciousness.",
          "I then experienced a state of wholeness, reintegration, and 'clear awareness.'",
          "It was just there.",
          "The experience I've been describing was consciously attempted.",
          "I cannot provoke it or achieve it with a specific thought, intention, activity, or the like.",
          "On the way home from the bus, while walking, I first tried to observe the sadness and then to feel the consciousness that feels/observes the sadness.",
          "Later, I learned to induce them.",
          "In one meditation, I had the feeling of vibrating.",
          "A little before, I had odd proprioception: my head felt turned right (it wasn't), and my body felt hollow.",
          "And depending on how strongly I can or want to detach myself from everything at the moment, I can influence the degree of perception, to make experiences or to change made experiences or to receive guidance, healing, insights, etc.",
          "The first experience was in the fall of 2018.",
          "It is easy.",
          "On the last day, we did a longer breath meditation, and I got into a state where I felt very comfortable and happy.",
          "So I think I was feeling a little despondent, thinking this was another waste of time.",
          "It was a very intensive time back then and I have always felt and perceived more than others...",
          "I felt like a conscious being; everything was included in this large, cosmic 'body' of mine, and a very subtle yet intense sense of happiness and bliss was present.",
          "It is as if a switch is flipped by the external setting, body and mind know, that's what it's about - this experience.",
          "In the other type of experience, I experience more space, air, openness.",
          "Difficult to explain, because at the same time it was, of course, absolutely not \"normal\" compared to my usual discursive everyday experience, but completely different...",
          "I'm an atheist, and this sounds silly, but yes, it happened.",
          "There was no personality associated with the noticing, no discernible quality; just the awareness of awareness, as such.",
          "Disappearance of words.",
          "Accordingly, I tried not only to liquidate \"myself\" mentally, but also absolutely everything I had learned, heard, internalized in terms of intellectual role models, and what was dear to me.",
          "There was a body, but it was not perceived any differently than anything else.",
          "Practicing Zen, observing thoughts, they came and went.",
          "The moment I noticed that, it was already gone.",
          "Gradually, the senses deepened, and I was able to only focus on my thought stream, to minimize them, further getting to the center of attention.",
          "It was subtle.",
          "Everything is Okay, with a capital O.",
          "The distinction between self and world no longer existed.",
          "But I am not frightened and can also allow another such moment.",
          "Or rather, something within me has gotten used to them.",
          "Best regards T. E.",
          "It feels like a weightless blanket is on my shoulders and around me, enveloping me but not delimiting me.",
          "But as long as I remain \"awake\", i.e., undistracted, it is clearly distinguishable that I can remain as an observer in the silence, even if there is a lot of movement in the mind.",
          "The boundary between my body and surroundings vanished.",
          "There were no more boundaries or different objects.",
          "My body acts so precisely, so perfectly and independently, intuitively—without me even having the opportunity to start a thought... until my consciousness understood what was happening, 'I' could observe my body in its absolutely precise action without feeling any fear or any emotion for even a moment.",
          "I could think quite normally and control my actions.",
          "But if I had to describe it (knowing that any description completely strips away the raw feeling and generally confirms the experience as largely ineffable), I would say I felt like pure awareness, without intentions or memories.",
          "There were no more body sensations, no thoughts, no feelings, no sensory perceptions, simply nothing at all.",
          "I had two out-of-body experiences of varying lengths – one experiences oneself \"on the ceiling,\" looks down at oneself and feels no connection to oneself anymore, \"feelings\" very neutral; I could explore the immediate surroundings and see other people \"below.\"",
          "Senses were extremely sharp and acute, yet I didn't form any opinions about the flowers I passed as I walked to the top of the hill, no words about anything inside or out, just, for lack of a better word, luminosity.",
          "Pure consciousness or non-dual experience of emptiness is form is where I can move from (whereas there is no functioning from pure awareness) and I live from here until there is identification with one form of limited consciousness that leads to a feeling of a small separate self inside a body, looking out of my eyes.",
          "I wish you well in your inquiries.",
          "The overriding factor is a deep, ineffable stillness; this occurs frequently in breath meditation as the breath becomes subtle and disappears, accompanied by subtle bliss.",
          "I was one with this experience.",
          "My experience occurred during meditation and it was about feeling and perceiving silence, pure silence as it hardly happens in our world.",
          "Was about a year back.",
          "I'm trying to stabilize this experience.",
          "A feeling of expanding, body boundaries dissolving.",
          "The relative 'I' was gone, and I remained alone.",
          "I knew that something special was happening but I also didn't linger on that feeling for too long for fear I might chase it away.",
          "'There is hearing going on' feels more correct.",
          "I was painting glass.",
          "It seemed like no alternative conclusion could be reached, other than that feeling.",
          "But when there is success, I manage to sustain this state that allows a sensation of presence, peace, freedom, fullness to manifest.",
          "But where is the focus?",
          "I know that I cannot do it.",
          "One becomes calmer, more relaxed.",
          "I – was little present in the moment but also alright.",
          "During long car rides, my consciousness switches to \"automatic.\"",
          "It is a very special experience that is difficult to describe.",
          "I've come to realize it's perhaps not as common for many as it is for myself, but I've always lived with a sense of bodily awareness in which I can focus in on a single point or my entire body at will.",
          "If I do this for a longer period of time, for example in a meditation retreat, then a feeling of light soon spreads in the mind.",
          "Those moments where you're aware of what's happening, you can even converse, but at the same time you're \"absent,\" calm, detached from everything and, for that very reason, able to pick up more details in expressions, in the tone of a conversation, etc.",
          "If not, it is a state of \"awareness\" for me, which practically flows without thoughts... Then I experience states of recognition or pure being or oneness or...",
          "This experience was somewhat frightening.",
          "But that's only because of the light penetrating through my eyelids.",
          "nothing else exists in the moment, then I cannot consciously and noticeably experience this awareness, because I no longer have a comparison from perception or memory available.",
          "If peace is defined by the emptiness of movement on each side of peace.",
          "The spaciousness was not confined to internal visual space but instead also included internal auditory space as well as somatic space.",
          "There was a deep quality of clarity and ease within me that seemed to blur the lines between my bodily limits and the awareness within my mind so that I was totally comfortable and undistracted in the present moment.",
          "There were also instinctive contractions that seemed to be both physical and mental that felt like the self trying to stay or come online.",
          "The leader said, \"You're too young to stay.",
          "It's just happening.",
          "I didn't know if, for example, my arms were above or below my legs.",
          "\"Silent\" and simultaneously \"speaking in tongues.\"",
          "The experience itself seems to be constructed by the way attention is used, and is sustained by how attention is placed, but the experience itself feels unconstructed.",
          "'Unity' best describes it, though this implies something beyond awareness, which wasn't the case—awareness was all there was.",
          "I kept the experience to myself; I had no one to confide in.",
          "Having the sensation that 'me' was no longer a fixed thing.",
          "I am absolutely focused on the silence and can bear it.",
          "I experience myself as body consciousness.",
          "I felt as if I was experiencing the fundamental structure of experience, during meditation.",
          "The thoughts of loneliness or being lost do not occur there because they do not exist in that space.",
          "Then everything took on this quality.",
          "But the egg is empty.",
          "Suddenly all the pain was gone, there were no thoughts, no physical sensations, only alert attention, joy and the sight of light on the wall in front of me.",
          "The conceptual mind was very active and insistently asked what was happening.",
          "It is not possible to lie here.",
          "It's very hard to explain, and it was only a very short moment.",
          "When I was walking on the gravel road and seeing insects or little animals passing bye, I felt an intense feeling of bliss at their sight.",
          "Having thus restored the contemplation of this 'new void', I emerged from the meditation with a sense of infinite lightness, but also sadness for not having been able to see beyond, deeper, a definitive truth that was palpable in the field of experience, but unattainable.",
          "It's like being in a vast space.",
          "My thoughts are still and I am in an oceanic body feeling, somehow body and yet also no body, but flowing energy.",
          "Feel that I am much more than just my body.",
          "Great happiness flows through me, at the same time a feeling of rootlessness, a feeling of not being there at all.",
          "My second experience was somewhat more dramatic.",
          "I suddenly felt safe and happy and thought that I had always wanted to fly in a dream.",
          "This is awareness of being without an 'apart me'.",
          "Another question; as connection with the other is the core of love, and tree and self are so intimately connected by their co-arising, then isn't the nature of the \"knowing\" part of this process also love?",
          "But then, at some point, material reality catches up with me again.",
          "One type is a very short noticing, often also frightening.",
          "I experienced a state of weightlessness, boundless corporeality, and the simultaneous existence of the self, the consciousness of my self without limitation, in complete peace.",
          "Otherwise, I wasn't particularly religious; I was simply sent to this church group by my family, which was quite entertaining.",
          "As I said, I was only in this space.",
          "The approximate course was as follows: During a free time between lectures at the university, running across the campus, I thought about ontological aspects of QFT and tried to imagine what a world might look like in which everything is connected and permeated by fields and constantly changes without individuality.",
          "The experience seems to be similar to a thread which forms a seam and holds on one side the body and on the other side infinity together, so both are there and yet they are not there, because they are put together.",
          "Lifting the dualistic viewpoint.",
          "Even though thoughts, sensations etc.",
          "I did an exercise by Richard Lang and for a brief moment felt a shift in perspective from a subjective to an \"objective\" one, as if the boundary between my face and the world was transparent.",
          "Each time completely unexpected, completely spontaneous.",
          "I find it difficult to put these in words other than a direct coming into touch with and knowing of experience as it unfolds including all sense modalities including thinking.",
          "The straightening up and walking afterwards feels very supple.",
          "I found myself saying, 'It can't be true, it can't be happening, it's impossible, miracle.'",
          "Certainly the experience is characterised by a different composition of structures in my consciousness, although a pertinent aspect of the experience is a sense of 'inevitable' or 'procedural' continuity from normal states, as if it is the natural result of reasoning processes playing out and being unfettered in their bleeding down into my full embodied consciousness.",
          "Furthermore, I felt a hard-to-describe feeling that thoughts were lurking in the back of my mind, of which I was fully aware, but I recognized their transience and insignificance.",
          "Flow states occurred regularly.",
          "Other times the state already exists and only gradually becomes conscious.",
          "The sense of self was strongly altered.",
          "- Since it happened to me very early on my meditative path, it probably also accompanied much more wonder and awe than truly clear recognition.",
          "I felt I perceived EVERYTHING, yet only a millionth part consciously.",
          "After a long inner struggle, we are now quite well reconciled: My self-aggressive compulsive behavior has since completely disappeared.....",
          "However, I was very frightened by this state.",
          "I hope I could help you a little and I will keep working on it.",
          "After minutes of a storm of thoughts, absolute quiet sets in: no thought waves, no physical sensations, the breathing is calm and slow.",
          "Tears streamed down my face.",
          "There was a universality about it.",
          "How could it go?",
          "I tried to describe as best as I could what happened.",
          "Intensive perception of body and environment.",
          "It's been hard lately due to job applications and resulting anxiety.",
          "They make it easier to take everything lightly and to recognize the humorous side of life.",
          "It's the most important thing to me, and I love sharing and teaching the practice to others—to bring them home.",
          "Though not relaxing (I wanted it to last), it was incredibly fulfilling and lasted a couple of hours.",
          "Then, just as suddenly, I was completely present again, more so than ever before, and in that presence, my son was born.",
          "For a few moments I vanished but was instead a void perceiving reality as a bright picture.",
          "\"let Graham do his thing… I can't see the unity in this…\".",
          "Then, during a session, this exploded into laughter.",
          "Everything is alright, as it is.",
          "I intensely feel my dream body, the wind on my skin, the warmth, the smell coming from the trees, but at the same time I'm connected to everything.",
          "It's an impulse.",
          "A few times, I continued; the quality of 'space' changes, becoming denser, mental activity decreasing to a point of 'highest purity' without mental activity.",
          "Love seemed to guide and color my whole experience.",
          "It was intense.",
          "Weightlessness is also an impression I remember, but I had felt this weightlessness as mirroring myself in water consciousness in an empty infinite space of fullness.",
          "This was my first experience in meditation where a fundamental inversion of the mode of perception and experience happened.",
          "I experience my Self as a unity, pure consciousness in which I may simply dwell.",
          "It is in this state where my experiences have occurred whereby I am a simple unified awareness, seemingly without the daytime qualities of ego.",
          "In my life there were three spiritual teachers (a Peruvian shaman, a German potter and a Nyingma Lama) who demonstrated this characteristic movement of space to me with their hands or confirmed this experience.",
          "I also saw a great light over a park.",
          "I can then be there and simply experience what is happening, and sometimes less and less happens in my mind, and I experience the gaps very strongly.",
          "The absolute silence in my mind was enormous and it was spacious, very spacious, perhaps endless.",
          "Later on stopped publishing the book and related activity.",
          "The others come from the walking meditation, I continue to sit.",
          "I don't quite agree with the description \"as if the mind were looking at itself\", it is rather a forced concentration of the present moment and that when this concentrative effort is released, this non-cognitive state sometimes naturally manifests itself.",
          "A sudden perfect clarity of experience.",
          "Emotions that arose in me were, from a normal perspective, negative.",
          "Because my thoughts and sensations and memories, especially of important people in my life, come to seem equally important, it becomes difficult to discern who exactly I am meant to be as a character among them.",
          "A sense of everything just is.",
          "This started when I was 12 years old.",
          "And then I also know very still states in which hardly any activities of the mind or body were perceptible.",
          "My experience was like being filled with energy, with my energy going out into the world.",
          "I could hear the quality of them as if being part of a person that I recognized, but no longer identified with.",
          "How can they take them seriously?",
          "As the state stabilizes (usually after many repetitions of turning attention onto itself), bodily sensations and the sense of possessing them diminish.",
          "In reverie, often hypnagogic, awareness sinks to a simple frequency/continuum, the same essence my entire life, unaffected by experiences, memories, or stories.",
          "A sense of 'self' was present, but not the agent or contributor—just part of the field of awareness.",
          "I am me and still I am everybody around me, every noise.",
          "Bright and clear, somehow sunny.",

          "My experiences in this regard are very different, which is why my markings may seem partly contradictory to you: they cannot be generalized because they depend on the different settings and the current state of being: for example, I often had to decide in which external setting these states had occurred in me.",

          "Often, there is a specific smell that sends me a 'signal' that I'm in it now (it's like a wood fire smell – very beautiful and like in a meditation cave).",
          "I call this experience 'being good at the practice'.",
          "These still existed and I still perceived them, but I was no longer identified with them.",
          "But not much attachment.",
          "My consciousness gently moves away from what is directly accessible or better, irritable, through sensory impressions and turns to an unknown space that is simply space.",
          "Incidentally, I have already systematically coached someone into this experience twice.",
          "This experience persists.",

          "Letting go of a project, or a dream, doesn't mean that I won't realize the dream or the project—it just means letting go of the *idea* that happiness has to *wait* until the task is accomplished—it means letting go of the *notion* that the accomplishment lies in the future—no, the only thing I can accomplish is *now*, whatever now presents, it is the *most* I can do.",

          "It's like a light bulb that slowly turns on, and parallel to its turning on, there is a sensation of presence; at this point it becomes difficult to describe.",
          "It has always been there.",
          "I was and remain fairly agnostic about intelligent spiritual entities.",
          "No visual images per se before closed eyes, but I saw again and again movements of energy/light shortly before and in between.",
          "I can't describe it, it was as if it were outside of me.",
          "The full and almighty power of Nature is the unseen mover behind every step of my evolution and nothing can stop it, I simply need to let it happen and keep the field of the relative out of the way by being self-referral at all times.",

          "Should I ever want to commit suicide, then immerse myself in this 'place'!!!",
          "During this experience, the cylinder's borders dissolved outward until there were no borders, no sense of 'the knower' from which attention originates.",
          "On the one hand, it felt as if I were shielded from the environment through my senses ('cheese bell', e.g., hearing, bodily sensations, etc.",
          "So there were definitely thoughts that were separated from this rather bodily experience.",
          "Movement or non-movement is irrelevant.",
          "I had given up trying to make sense of the discussion….",

          "Language cannot grasp the experience (as already stated in the question).",
          "At the same time, I notice how familiar it is to me; as soon as I direct my attention inward, this experience is there again.",
          "Entering the core of the core is where I'm drawn.",
          "I have noticed this to be a constant in the experiences that have happened to me; I end up inside without realizing it, as long as I remain there, sensations of: unity, infinity, wonder, subtle joy, peace, expansion prevail; the phase of 'returning to myself' is all the more traumatic the more intense the state experienced has been.",
          "I instinctively knew how to move, needing no help.",
          "The experience made me joyful and also a little afraid.",
          "I know nothing about myself.",

          "That said, in that realm of existence, I don't feel the need to do anything or be anywhere, just simply existing in a limbo.",
          "After these states, it was difficult to come back because they are so light and peaceful.",
          "It is almost always accompanied by either the sensation of bright colors (usually yellows, sometimes green, red, blue or purple).",
          "Adjectives I would use to describe the state: vivid, light, at peace, sharp, beautiful, sublime, awesome, natural, effortless, blissful (but more as an absence of pain than a euphoric sensation), detailed.",
          "This was also an experience that I gratefully accepted.",
          "Bright white color.",
          "Then I experienced being progressively very unified (body and mind jointly united) and of great bliss without discursive thoughts or interference of images, I was totally present; at the same time an indescribable lightness, an inner silence and a widening of consciousness but also of the body which was nevertheless dense at the same time; I felt like sitting deep within myself; time no longer existed but I was very aware of the variations in my environment, my consciousness and my body were more \"lucid\" and I saw things as if through transparency, that is to say that I felt what was behind the phenomena, the words, the things perceived by my senses; with an intuitive acuity and a deep peace because nothing bothered me; I was both in a bodily sensation of subtlety/lightness and at the same time with the weight and solidity of a mountain.",
          "The body concept dropped along with breathing effort.",

          "While meditating, at a certain point I had the perception of all the surrounding space, to infinity, as if it were part of my body.",
          "It began when I lost the feeling that certain subjects of consciousness (i.e., hearing, feeling) were connected to a location.",
          "Once during a guided fantasy journey, I was told, among other things, that there was light, bright radiant light in a forest clearing, and suddenly I myself was light.",
          "Settling in, letting go, and finding my 'sea-legs', I then explored.",
          ":) A few years ago, a very deep, central and silent part of my brain suddenly became activated as if somebody flipped a switch and a heretofore unused part of my machinery came online and has since been available to me.",
          "For years, I couldn't speak of it, but I often reflected on this 'eternity' experience—no time, only being.",
          "I realised that its luminosity was a gift arising in consciousness moment by moment with no attempt to try to understand.",
          "One single yellow rose with red highlights lit up in a way which expressed the experience.",
          "Still, although birds could be heard.",
          "Later, a state of wakeful presence sets in, a brief moment of emptiness that knows no I, the world is one.",

          "Around 30 minutes, I tried to 'look behind myself,' as in Dzogchen teachings, where awareness is primordial, behind everything.",
          "This description takes nothing away from the collapsing surprise when one enters the experience.",
          "This experience has created an access in me in which this overwhelming awareness can fly in like a bird and immediately fly out again.",
          "Therefore, since 1975 intensive bioenergetic and biodynamic body therapy - with a lot of extreme catharsis, with screaming, raging, stamping, hitting, rebelling against authorities and their violence, etc.",

          "Conclusion: What I experienced there in Vipassana, the \"Transpersonal,\" has remained with me - as a basic component of my person.",
          "As if everything else I know is a dream, an illusion, behind a veil.",
          "I then feel warmth/pleasant energy centered in my abdomen, connected to the earth, without a real center, warmth and vastness, unity and openness.",
          "It is dark in the sense of no light and no color.",
          "The all was everything, including me noticing it, everything, nothing excluded; even my noticing was there, but there was no 'here' from which I was looking.",

          "Then again, there was not a feeling of separation between knower and known; if anything it was that those two things felt the same.",
          "During a 7-day retreat, during a walking meditation in nature, I suddenly had the feeling that time stood still, the whole world stood still.",

          "Only one, the All, that changes.",
          "It has a paradoxical character...",
          "The perception of the body disappears without one noticing it.",
          "Often felt like I was floating, not physically floating but rather without a care as I knew, really knew, there's no doing, no thinking, whatever it is, works itself out, my unconscious brain or some divine source or whatever.",
          "Afterward, accessing this awareness became easier, but the initial impression remains most vivid.",
          "In the previous questionnaire, I focused on the former state, which is less intense and recurs in short or longer moments during meditation.",
          "There are all objects as usual.",
          "I relate the answers to such a \"non\"-experience.... upon returning from this \"nothing,\" deeper insights and information surfaced within me with the first thoughts.... Now it is so that I can effortlessly immerse myself in a peaceful, joyful state of being daily.... the 'I' feeling becomes infinite space.",
          "My self-awareness returned in surprise/awe; I perceived my body map and felt my body might collapse.",
          "I sat for a very long time, and at some point I just 'knew' that I was temporarily liberated.",
          "Rather, it is probably an exception (at least in my case) if I am only conscious without this consciousness being accompanied by a witness.",
          "Being alone meditating and with others.",
          "Maybe I will find suitable medication sometime.",
          "The usual pain in my knees that I experience when sitting in a cross-legged position was gone, I could sit up straight relatively easily and I was wondering where my body ends.",
          "And all these answers to the questionnaire are only from what I describe as the fragrance that was left when I returned somehow from the state.",
          "They recede into the background as meaningless, and a very present emptiness comes to the foreground, but it is more than the space between the objects.",
          "Through speaking, the connection becomes less and less.",
          "There was no sense of naming these things or of knowing what they were but a distinct sense of change.",
          "Since this experience, I have been able to return there again and again.",
          "I sank into a strange experience of boundless consciousness, became very alert to sounds around me but without the will to open my eyes.",
          "During stressful times, I don't get into the state, no matter how long I sit.",

          "My air supply was getting scarcer and I got scared.",
          "I went on a weekend retreat and gave up all the striving because up to this point, I now realise I was running at full speed on the path of unenlightenment.",

          "My husband said, \"You're different.",
          "Book does not talk about Silence in the absence of thought, which is recurrent experience since 2010.",
          "It occurred during a meditation, a perfectly clear, calm attentiveness like a clear vibration of the whole body, which is perceptible as such but not limited or identity-forming, a timelessness and spacelessness and yet clear awareness of sounds without reaction or that 'something' would follow.",
          "I was born in 1942, male, a traumatized war child, with the experience of \"bomb on the house,\" escape, abandonment, loneliness, being beaten, emotional poverty, etc.",
          "This has created a deep connection with nature and a reduction of the ego.",
          "It was peaceful there, and I could barely feel my body, and occasionally not at all.",

          "The knowledge of the total purity of the interactions between the elements of this bath.",
          "Some questions in the test were difficult for me to answer because I partly had no feelings, neither thirst nor tiredness, no needs, simply (aware-)being.",
          "From the experience I referenced in this questionnaire: While meditating, seated, trying to understand 'who am I?",
          "Through nonsensical questions for which there is no answer, I reach this exploratory gap between two thoughts.",
          "In this state there was no sense of self, but sounds were perceptible.",
          "I relived my life, or what was important in it, but all at once, without a linear or chronological order, I relived everything as if objectively, morally, by clearly realizing the value of everything I had done, feeling the sensations of others, from the position of those or that which was receiving good and bad from me.",
          "In answering the questions, I have focused less on Zazen experiences, but rather on everyday experiences, for example when I have worked with the metaphor of \"the sky with clouds\", so to experience the \"sky\" for a moment in the sense of pure awareness in everyday reality.",
          "I felt aware of being the only being.",
          "No euphoria, rather sober coolness with a hint of an inner smile and the feeling of being completely with oneself.",
          "We all are and live to make experiences.",
          "By everything I mean the quite normal perception of things, thoughts, feelings... Oh dear - another attempt, but I really can't describe it...",
          "This particular experience happened on a walk through the forest, and began with a clear shift of perception into what felt like a timeless state, a sense of wonder, and, in particular, a sense that I knew this state of mind already, even though I didn't.",
          "My experience is best described by simply being in the moment and recognizing that everything arises in consciousness, even one's own ego and concentration.",
          "Even though the experience, in this specific case, felt very much like an on/off light switch... it also felt like something that was achievable at the end of a spectrum.",
          "In retrospect, it becomes clear that the experience was more complex than the term 'pure awareness' implies, so it was more than just 'presence' (of what???)",
          "I had the insight to feel the workings of life.",
          "While we were listening to Goenka's words, the whole experience began.",
          "Somewhere in between the two I guess.",
          "A huge, boundless, absolutely still room, which, however, has a circular shape.",
          "regarding temperature, pressure, volume,...).",
          "Thought is occurring in this awareness which is also aware of itself.",
          "Everything was connected; no 'I', no body, pure Being.",
          "It feels like true nature.",
          "From inside the experience, there was nothing that existed to provide any effort, so of course it did not need any.",
          "There is no inside, no outside, no up, no down.",
          "It's like a groping, a tactile sense with ever-changing quality.",
          "Once, however, it was bathed in dazzling white light.",
          "Everything is right.",
          "In one peak state, it was an experience as if I could taste the awareness; it was sweet (non-sensual taste).",
          "This happened without worry and fear.",
          "Great joy and gratitude.",
          "Experiences that were not fully experienced can, want and must be relived again.",
          "I was awareness itself, yet embedded, carried, sheltered, and absolutely safe within it.",
          "I simply was.",
          "And yet everything that has been 'swallowed' is subtly present.",
          "Although I think the duration of the experience was brief (maybe a minute or so), the experience was stable enough for me to recall it when I returned to a more reflective state.",
          "All sensory perceptions were vivid.",
          "Although I already knew the dish, the food initially tasted better than usual (similar to a shift in consciousness, but only related to the sense of taste, not substance-induced or attributable to a mental illness) and I suddenly experienced myself as sharply centered and in the middle, which triggered a great inner lightness and joy.",
          "Every time until... yes, where did the KT examination actually take place?",
          "It is completely dark, no light or bliss.",
          "It was also a perception of a complete, deep silence.",
          "Not being religious, I was paralyzed and in awe.",
          "There was only a kind of very finest glimmer, a last remnant of consciousness which was only aware of itself and nothing else.",
          "I felt I had experienced this as a child.",
          "It was a great help to me.",
          "The world I was experiencing no longer existed independently, because I had become the unfolding of that experience.",
          "Deep relaxation, stress reduction.",
          "I sit and am.",
          "All senses were available, alive, I was fully aware of the sensory experiences, but the experience felt incredibly, unbelievably light, ephemeral, dreamlike and beautiful.",
          "I then feel a \"pull\" within me; something pulls me to itself, and it feels as if this does not come from my own will but is done with me.",
          "Looking back at the experience now, it seemed as if everything merged into an undifferentiated whole while simultaneously maintaining the appearance of individuation (e.g., there was still a perception of \"trees,\" colors, the coolness of the air, but not in the least bit as contrasts such as \"ground\" vs. \"sky\" (as if they were fundamentally different), gray vs. brown, warmth vs. cool.",
          "The decisive characteristic of my experiences was the experience of very deep rest with fewer and fewer thoughts.",
          "This manifests as an undefinable feeling of unease, which becomes increasingly pressing until I become aware of my creatureliness and my body, startle awake and take a deep breath, then of course I'm out of the state :-) Occasionally I also startle because I no longer know who I am, where I am, and what I am.",
          "I was able to have this experience again every day for about half a year.",
          "They had no driving, demanding quality over me.",
          "I found this experience fascinating and liberating.",
          "Another insightful week.",
          "Today, I wanted to let go of specific exercises and find spaciousness again.",
          "As if I could drink or eat this feeling of awareness.",
          "I had the impression of briefly experiencing the unsubstantiality of Shunyata, then turned my attention away from it, and noticed how the next impression was still like unsubstantial Shunyata - that was impressive and encouraging.",
          "I attained a state where I felt I could ask any question, or rather face any question, and I would find the answer, within me.",
          "And this time completely objectively and emotionally.",
          "I don't know if having those thoughts/desires negates the experience; I hope it still counts!",
          "My knee pain vanished, as did my sense of time.",
          "It was as if the usual relationship between what was experienced by means of (or \"with,\" or \"as\") \"I,\" on the one hand, and pure experience, on the other, had completely reversed.",
          "I now feel that nothing new was discovered, but it can now be seen for the first time.",
          "It's like drawing deep strength and refueling.",
          "During meditation, I entered a bright (non-visual) mental weightlessness that was boundless and yet offered a non-tactile/non-visual space of security.",
          "I don't find a self; I enter a non-dual state.",
          "For my concept of enlightenment, I therefore refer to the March issue of Ursache/Wirkung :-)",
          "Opening the eyes to the whole surroundings bathed in shimmering luminous clear light.",
          "I had been just watching the corridor without any thought.",
          "A feeling of being sucked in.",
          "During the 'turning,' an amused thought arose: 'What idiot hid joy in the midst of heartbreak?'",
          "Below I give short descriptions of experienced states in meditations, mostly on retreats, and as best I can remember the respective event.",
          "This first occurrence I could rather describe as a unitary or enlightenment experience, however, it extended over many days and I best describe it as a 'first fall into the now'.",
          "There are no more separations.",
          "I would like to share a third experience here, which has to do with a three-month course and its practical effects.",
          "The more I \"refuel\" from it, the more fulfilling, lighter, and more joyful my entire activity becomes.",
          "I had a feeling that entering might be dangerous for me because I might leave my old world and might not be able to come back.",
          "No longer just the head, consciousness, but the whole conscious body-being.",
          "When I then believed that this would kill me, and yet completely surrendered to it (\"Let the other monks bury me here tonight!",
          "The feeling of expansion into all-encompassing vastness.",
          "It's beautiful and familiar.",
          "I felt like a humongous sphere; my awareness wasn't in my body but in a big sphere around it.",
          "All perceptions of the body were there, but had no connection and no connection to anything, but lay spread out on a desk.",
          "Things simply are.",
          "No fear, no anxiety.",
          "In other words: Because the perception processes were in the foreground, I experienced a feeling of connectedness with the world – paradoxically, the closer I am to myself (focus on breath/body), the more the experience of connectedness arises.",
          "The answer was given.",
          "The experience was the noticing of noticing.",
          "Always and already.",
          "While the meditative experience of this awareness's salience can come and go, the sense is that the awareness doesn't itself go anywhere; what's transient are the objects that divert my attention from it.",
          "Anything that wasn't the unfolding contents of awareness no longer had any meaning.",
          "A paradox: On the one hand, aware of the biographical identity (development, change), on the other hand, unchanging, untouchable consciousness (pure consciousness, witness consciousness).",
          "Otherwise the sense of me as a person was very broad - I was completely aware of myself and in harmony with what was happening and the surroundings.",
          "I am aware of myself in it, in the unity of mind-body/body-mind (our linguistic means unfortunately fail here), completely grounded and therefore not separated.",
          "There was neither body nor thought, feeling... only 'BEING'.",
          "I speak of pure consciousness when inner consciousness is very present.",
          "I very much enjoyed staying in this state.",
          "The world doesn't exist independently; it's a play of consciousness, a reflection of our state of being.",
          "I experienced pure awareness as a kind of timeless and spaceless being.",
          "With that, the fascination for pure consciousness slowly came to an end.",
          "Distinct from that is being IN the phenomena, experiencing them intensely 'juicy', three-dimensionally, immediately identical.",
          "It is as it is.",
          "My consciousness expanded immensely, like a balloon—no boundaries.",
          "I was lying down, but not asleep, when I entered a world of white.",
          "I stood beside it, seeing myself deeply connected to everything.",
          "If I am very tired, it can tip over into sleep.",
          "Unfortunately, it faded after a few days, but it is still something special for me when I remember it, as now.",
          "Absolute bodilessness and timelessness, begins with pleasant heaviness and then lets go of more and more body and mind",
          "I also became aware that I did not want to meet anybody, because this would almost inevitably have interrupted the precious silence, the wonderful clarity.",
          "Everything is authentic.",
          "It has to do with a rhythm linked to breathing that becomes a unison between me and every form of life around me.",
          "Part of my mind automatically wondered if I was dreaming, and I instantly knew I was because my entire existence at that moment was just me, a light switch, and an intense, unconnected terror.",
          "As if they were permeable, liquid, transparent, not present, although I already knew that they were present.",
          "I focused on my bass guitar.",
          "In the foreground of perception is not any kind of limitation, but unity and interconnectedness.",
          "There was a texture of brightness and spaciousness, an emptiness where there was no 'me', no 'anything else'.",
          "In addition, I 'tipped in and out' of these states over days.",
          "The egg has a shell-like boundary, but it is not visible, not tangible, not perceptible.",
          "Doing this seems to almost instantly thrust \"me\" out of a state of concepts and limitation.",
          "For the rest of the retreat I struggled to put any concepts together.",
          "There was a self-awareness, a sense of duration, but no objects and no own body.",
          "And there is something deeper, just be with that something deeper, innocence, there is nothing to know, to be a child, a blank slate taking it all in with no judgement, I AM even though I AM not!",
          "I cannot recognize the \"nothing\" in the \"nothing\".",
          "You have a daughter at home.\"",
          "There was no longer any spatial, temporal, or felt difference.",
          "I experienced it as if the \"air\" in my head became less dense.",
          "😳🤣 Can you believe it?",
          "In my own words I would like to call this \"encounter with intimate quality\".",
          "I am... Not detached, but connected to the outside.",
          "Perhaps it is also interesting that shortly before the peak experience I believed that I was opening a forbidden, red door, like a kind of warning.",
          "I notice that practice and environment influence how strong, reliable, and long this state occurs.",
          "It is almost like that which normally is aware of the boundaries of a human body became aware of a bigger body, somehow much less personal and yet just as personal.",
          "It is as if there were a gap through which sensations could penetrate.",
          "So I begin to express some doubts or wishes (that I remember).",
          "However, I have studied Philosophy of Mind and Cognitive Science and have a deep interest in phenomenology.",
          "At this point, tears came to my eyes and I began thinking and the experience dissipated.",
          "Nevertheless, my teacher persuaded me to try it at least once.",
          "There was only the infinitely large space of security, gentleness & freedom.",
          "This can be compared to looking into a bright light becoming increasingly strong; soon you will turn away or close your eyes simply because the light is so intense.",
          "Like a dissolution of the self into an endless blue sky.",
          "It was the most beautiful and important experience of my life and continues to shape me, five years later.",
          "I attribute the experience to an activation of my nervous system in some way.",
          "I expand into the \"space\" (or shrink to nothing—paradoxically, the same).",
          "My experience occurred during a Douglas Harding 'Tube experiment'.",
          "I experienced the bubble of my mind, paying attention to the sensations in my body, from a certain level of detachment from the bubble.",
          "Actually nowhere, I only have the feeling that what I see/hear etc.",
          "Still, there is emotion and thoughts and stress.",
          "Tactile sensations and frog sounds were generated in the same field of consciousness, without inner/outer distinction.",
          "They appeared spontaneously.",
          "The disidentification of thoughts and emotions was amazing; I stopped feeling thought.",
          "I am in the egg but not present in it at the same time.",
          "It's beautiful, like a dream, a unique conscious expression.",
          "I didn't notice the floor or my surroundings.",
          "The experience was a pure awareness of the sound of the bird, such that I was no longer aware of being aware (i.e., as a meditating, perceiving subject).",
          "This gives it a dual sensation of the awareness both falling into itself as constantly creating itself.",
          "(Measured by the quality of body functions and brain waves)",
          "I feel very liberated, light, carefree and smiling.",
          "After that, there were two further experiences of wholeness at the ages of 12 and about 15.",
          "There was no self but just the breath.",
          "Everything that I thought was a distraction *is* the present moment.",
          "If I lived in a two-dimensional world, I might have perceived a two-dimensional space.",
          "In moving meditations (e.g., heart chakra), I get into a feeling of less thinking more quickly.",
          "There was a feeling of energy, non-visual brightness, unity and expansiveness.",
          "For a brief moment I felt myself simultaneously in the here and now and in infinity.",
          "Tactilely, the broad base of the meditation seat naturally acts as a support.",
          "I opted for the second, making the situation an opportunity for practice.",
          "I'll try a little.",
          "A few times also consciously to cross the border to 100%, with the perception of the real transition from duality into unity and later the return.",
          "One could express it this way: There is no waking, there is no sleeping, there is only being.",
          "While I was witnessing this I was crying, of joy, of humility, of thankfulness, of shame for not having realized this truth before, of having been inattentive to the most important.",
          "Everything was good.",
          "The emptiness was luminous.",
          "Then I was forgiven.",

          "The thread is there and the thread can wind itself around the body or wind itself around the infinite, while holding both together.",
          "The fear that arose from this was the only thing that was really connected to \"me\".",
          "Rather, I was identified with an awareness that perceived these thoughts and feelings without itself feeling anything.",
          "Depending on the environment, I experience lasting calm and alertness.",
          "Instead, all there was was a cloud of sensation.",
          "From this, a state of total lack of desire, fulfillment beyond fulfillment, incredible inner peace, which may remain for a long time, quickly arises.",
          "While grocery shopping: experiencing deep peace, self-awareness, happiness.",
          "Our all nature.",
          "The silence was so deep that nothing more (no I) was there, and at the same time I knew that I was sitting in the Zendo.",
          "It also feels really, really good; there's a texture of pleasure to it.",
          "I could control my thoughts, I could move my body – but I don't, or only to a minimal extent.",
          "Nothingness, as nothingness, cannot exist; 'only' existence.",
          "I regard this experience as a feeling of unity and I feel truly connected to our universe during these states.",
          "So different that it cannot be described in the context of this discursive mode, but only hinted at!",
          "Suddenly, I only saw dazzling white light and tried to squint my eyes to reduce it, which didn't work.",
          "In this space they were simply there and without judgment.",
          "There is nothing that I could not have known and experienced.",
          "I had only one very slow thought passing by, as if it was passing inside the dark field, and it translates into something like - \"This is it.\"",
          "The experience of spaciousness can expand greatly depending on the situation and increase in radiance (not visual) and power/light/depth/width/clarity/knowing, depending on how deep the connection is, depending on how little distraction/grasping there is.",
          "While experiencing this state of \"pure awareness\", I had the feeling of simply being.",
          "Then we relax by letting concentration dissolve into awareness within time.",
          "That's when the intense experience ended.",
          "I was aware of my breath, body sensations, sounds, and even my self and its anxiety.",
          "I always said to myself – in essence: \"Oh, that's it again!\"",

          "Everything was suspended, inexplicable, without foundation.",
          "Strange feeling of groundedness/heaviness and connection with one's own body and simultaneous detachment from unpleasant/painful sensations - the body felt somehow ageless - body in itself - not exactly this body - enormous stability/rootedness with the ground/earth - and simultaneously connected with feelings of mentally transcending the current space - connectedness and encompassing and feeling of belonging with all living beings - absolute tenderness therein and a feeling of leaving the specific space behind (Metta meditation) * Similar experience before/during anesthesia induction - feelings of oneness with all living beings/loved ones and lightness/time perception strongly altered",

          "And there was a kind of desire to do that.",
          "Thereby \"I\" was as big as the universe.",
          "And that brought me step by step to a deeper level, to a state of consciousness I had never experienced before.",
          "I wondered if I was looking at my waking self looking at a mirror.",
          "Afterwards, I was as awake, conscious, relaxed, desireless, and content as never before in my life.",

          "I did perceive these sensations, but quickly let them go.",
          "After half an hour I allow myself another 2-5 minutes to reorient myself; I have the feeling of having been completely \"gone\" without falling asleep.",
          "But since it is very non-conceptual, my mind \"gave up\" trying to grasp the experience and instead surrendered to it and just let it happen.",
          "In fact, I really didn't even know I was in such a state, yet being in it, until the mind suddenly produced a few thoughts, which I observed as if they were phenomena outside myself.",

          "The experience took place during a retreat while walking in the woods: I felt completely open in all my senses, everything bright, clear, dynamic, connected to everything, no time or self-reference during the direct experience, everything ok and that's how it is, in harmony with life and the universe, without separations.",
          "I imagined having no head.",

          "It took no effort to maintain.",
          "I don't really know any more which it is, but I do know that it helps me—it is a nuance that I had rather glossed over, and in fact, it is quite a new thing for me to regularly practice the last four exercises of the sixteen, having been focused on the first eight for the last twenty years or so.",

          "I need 1-2 minutes of concentration on something, e.g., my breath, and consciously let go of emerging thoughts.",
          "It is blissful and yet very simple, still and empty.",
          "The experience has been one of pure calmness and bliss, I think in actual time, it has been very short, but the sensation is one of expanse and timelessness.",
          "It was a paradoxical feeling of total awareness and effortless absence.",
          "Even more astonishing to me was that I had the same level of clarity and insight into the psychological patterns of everybody with whom I interacted.",

          "Positive effects (health, anxiety reduction, success) were especially noticeable in my early years.",
          "Nothing has changed in the particulars of the visual, auditory and tactile sensations - it was still vivid and gently moving in the wind - except there is no 'meaning' in it because there is no-one for it to be meaningful.",

          "This coming and going of this elevation can be experienced very clearly.",
          "Everything disappeared: the people in the dream, buildings, my body, everything dissolved.... what remained was pure attention, deeper black bodiless space, seemingly endless,...",
          "It has a mild resemblance to smoking dimethyltryptamine at a low dose—no chaos, but a sense of third-party observation of subjective experience.",
          "I am there and have the feeling that I could sit here forever.",
          "It was amazed looking around, amazed listening to the silence, just breathing.",

          "The image that came – even during the experience – and which I think describes it best is that of a television (before there were 24/7 programs): First, there was no program anymore, then there were only some bars, and finally, they disappeared leaving everything blank and no television at all.",
          "My first experience was as a very young child where I felt like everything was very big, a very strange sensation where I felt that everything was enormous and I got scared.",
          "I remained in a somewhat more joyful state for a few days and then I returned entirely to my normal self with the memory of what had happened.",
          "This is a normative... condition which is able to notice itself at any time.",
          "The person who guided me came to me and spoke to me, but then I simply burst into tears.",
          "The experience was \"who is speaking there?\"",
          "Again there is no difference between the energies (or the feel of them) of thought and clear light – there is the basic difference in spaciousness, but when moving from still clear light to the thought clear light there is also a spaciousness about it, as it is the focus of the awareness at the time - there is nothing else at that point but the clear light of the thought – the only clear light at that instant.\"",
          "Another aspect is the fact that in Buddhism it is described as something great to happen to you, so in the beginning of the experience there are also thoughts of positive judgment, and a want to maintain the experience and not let it go.",
          "At the time I practiced taking the light as a meditation object as I was falling asleep.",
          "And that led to the fact that I could accept myself as a person very well.",
          "Moreover, a strong, but not unpleasant pressure or force is to be felt in the head area.",
          "During this experience, awareness felt expanded, but not self-reflecting.",
          "In the beginning, this Peace came many times.",
          "Everything is connected.",
          "Other experiences involved dissolving and oneness with all, but without the silver density.",
          "It feels so familiar, our natural state.",
          "A very 'saturated' feeling.",
          "It is very difficult to put into words, but I remember those experiences as discursive thought and the sense of there being a self/an observer ceasing and instead just perceiving \"raw\" sensory input very clearly.",
          "Laying down and almost immediately locking into Basal Clarity.",
          "I was completely empty, able to 'see' everyone on the mat, even those behind me.",

          "Everything comes, everything goes.",
          "It has happened in several really dangerous accident situations—I have never had so much as a scratch, but without this, what I call body awareness, I could just as well be dead.",
          "The state forms the background to everything experienceable.",
          "Sudden loud noises from the street outside didn't startle me or trigger any response; they were just part of my experience of the moment, and with total calmness, I let them come and go.",
          "No reference of self or other.",
          "I was the doctor, the patient, and myself simultaneously.",
          "The difference between subject and object dissolved.",
          "Previously, my center of awareness felt like a cylinder within my field of awareness.",
          "I am in Zen Sesshin, and towards the end of one of the 25-minute sitting periods, it's as if I'm no longer there.",
          "I felt connected and not untethered from myself, but just had a greater sense of internality and externality and yet how these were both somehow arbitrary.",
          "No self-reference, everything can be, merging, a still life happening by itself.",
          "I am this creation field, still energy containing all creation as a delicate structure, potential.",
          "I could sit with my eyes open and look around, amazed by the feeling of warm softness and silence that held everything.",
          "For the first 10 minutes, my mind drifted.",
          "My internal world and the external world were 'complete' in and of themselves.",
          "Everything is suddenly brighter.",
          "Objects and people around me are no longer separate; my body is just another field of sensation with awareness in it.",
          "Even if, through the feeling of this intensely experienced joy, a part of the mind seems almost overwhelmed, it has nevertheless arrived in such a way that no thought activity distracts, but the powerful presence as self-empowerment, like a coronation, like a radiation that purifies everything that distracts, especially any forms of pain or limitations.",
          "What followed the three particles was a timeless event, without space or perception, a feeling of complete restfulness and peace unlike any other 'peaceful' state I had felt before, it was deeper.",
          "There must have, on a subtle level, still been an observer there, since I have a few conceptual memories of the experience.",
          "There was an understanding of how the world works and how the self forms.",
          "It would be as if the \"observer\" were no longer in my body, but everywhere in my perception.",
          "This initially frightened me quite a bit, and the need arose for me to decide: Do I allow what is happening here, or do I get out?",
          "I was told to notice no difference between me and the object; we're all qualities of awareness.",
          "The intensity sometimes differs.",
          "I will try to describe it like this: In my normal experience, I – despite better knowledge and also despite this experience – have the feeling that \"I\" experience something.",
          "I never knew there was anything beyond the thinking (monkey) mind.",
          "Then again as a very simple being-there.",
          "The thoughts that arose were not 'spontaneous' thoughts, but rather controlled reflections – but the head was also rather still – it was more a seeing and experiencing with the heart.",
          "One only notices the disconnection when consciousness realizes that it moves completely freely as light in an infinite space.",
          "It's like a mole tunnel, deeper into the earth.",
          "I felt the urgency to drop my state and adopt his to communicate.",
          "But at the same time, there was nothing spectacular about it (therefore \"normal\").",
          "There were no limits, and it merged with the cushion on which I was sitting and extended throughout the room.",
          "It helps me to sit or lie down relaxed and to block out my surroundings.",
          "Two-dimensional designs developed complex, colorful and animated depth.",
          "In addition, I have had experiences in which there was deep love and connection with everything in and around me – without this feeling very personal, but simply reflecting the connectedness that is.",
          "I experience the pulling in the head region; in doing so, seeing reverses direction: instead of outwards, the gaze turns back on itself.",
          "These thoughts came slowly, 'floating' at the periphery of this 'cosmic' being.",
          "I close my eyes again.",
          "And it's as if my skin under the surface puffs up/relaxes.",
          "It was soft.",
          "This means that I can hardly assign certain memories and sensations to a specific phase.",
          "It was as if we were parts of a picture that can see each other.",
          "A tiny gap in thought can - with a deep breath - be expanded in an instant to a temporally extended gap.",
          "Later in life I realized in meditation that there are people who actively realize this love, this stream of love.",
          "Aligned, my perceptions were simple.",
          "All these arisings of personality, fear, liking, protecting, thoughts, ideas, were just popping into being in a vast, vast, warm, infinite space of awareness.",
          "It became clear to me, and it was as if a play was played to me to illustrate this, that my life on earth was just a temporary creation, or a game, that all my encounters with other people, with everything, were arranged for me, as situations, but that myself, and all these encountered, were now lifted away, and it was revealed, that there were but creatures, who had been put there to play a role, as characters in a play, who collapse back into the actors they really are, when the show is over, and go back behind the scene to rest, like puppets.",
          "However, since I had no meditation experience at that time, I was so frightened that I ended this state.",
          "In addition, I perceive the people around me with great clarity and can recognize how they feel.",
          "With eyes closed and headphones on, however, I experienced an incredibly expansive visual spaciousness that in certain moments went beyond expansive towards limitless.",
          "At that moment, everything felt like it would begin again, continuously.",
          "Words drop away.",
          "The path is not easy, though upon return it seems easy.",
          "Pure awareness set in during a break from a 10-day retreat.",
          "Awareness of the body during experiences: The awareness of the body is there and at the same time it is not there.",
          "What happened subsequently is beyond words, and any attempt to render it directly or indirectly risks being misleading, banal, and is certainly inadequate, incomplete, contradictory.",
          "Then again an activation of the intellect, which leads to a nesting; observing oneself observing oneself while observing oneself.",
          "In the course of lying there, I eventually fell deeper and deeper into myself (body/mind).",
          "The states I used as a basis for answering the questions were simply a feeling of endless expansion, vastness, calm, brightness, timeless well-being.",
          "At that moment, the thoughts became increasingly fewer and only appeared very sporadically, clearly visible.",
          "In that moment, I was so overwhelmed by this purity that tears streamed down my face.",
          "When it becomes a little weaker, I know that I am fully present, it can just become \"too much\", and then everything disappears in it.",
          "I was sitting with my eyes open during the exercise.",
          "The more one practices and progresses on their spiritual path, the more one understands that these experiences are a 'positive byproduct,' gifts from the Divine to be let go of, not to be identified with, lest one becomes stuck in spiritual growth and blocks the door to liberation.",
          "3) Then as awareness becomes where \"I\" am aware from (with a different, non-conceptual, non-head centered or non-mindful meditator centered sense of boundless, timeless no-self awake awareness) there is the first appearance of forms of consciousness like vibration, sensation, sound.",
          "My life hasn't been problem-free, but experiences of pure being enriched it with deeper meaning and understanding.",
          "Previous states of boundaries are ever becoming more permeable and eventually simply do not exist any longer when I remember -- or one could also say: grasp, because it seems to be quite an instantaneous understanding -- more and more my unbounded nature.",
          "One experience was a feeling of a dreamlike state that lasted for several days, where everything was harmonious, in order, easily perceivable, but I felt little to no urge to react to what I was experiencing.",
          "And the best thing is that it felt so right, almost as if I had finally arrived home after being lost for a very long time.",
          "I don't feel any pain, fear, sadness, anger, disgust, shame or guilt.",
          "I was sitting with eyes open and paying attention to my breath.",
          "An inner completion takes place.",
          "I was shaped by the feeling of fulfillment, wisdom, and knowledge, without being able to specify it.",
          "In that moment, I was one with everything around me.",
          "I gladly take this gift home with me.",
          "It's hard to describe—a space where there's no difference between observer and observed, perceiver and perception—everything simply *is*.",
          "Nothing else existed but here and now and ultimately a deep feeling of peace and quiet joy.",
          "I went there.",
          "My heart is overflowing in streams of love and bliss, ready to embrace and serve the whole world.” “The result of my daily practice of the Yogic Flying Technique is like a miracle to me.",
          "It was a valuable experience I can sometimes invoke, though not on the same scale.",
          "This put everything on the same plane.",
          "The participants were tasked with finding their true selves and sharing this at the end of the session.",
          "Before that, I heard many crows screaming in the field and the loud street noise of a nearby road.",
          "And suddenly there is realization and all the heaviness and firmness dissolves and there is awareness that this life draws from a source that is always there but not perceived.",
          "The gong sounds at the end, the others leave the room for walking meditation, I simply stay seated.",
          "I feel an inner warmth and brightness that I radiate.",
          "I don't know how long this feeling of being everything and ceasing to feel pain lasted.",
          "From one moment to the next, I suddenly became a silent witness to my sensory perceptions and actions, e.g., playing with other children.",
          "I was looking from afar, outside my body, yet completely present and aware of details.",
          "It's hard to describe, and this might not make sense, but I experienced what felt like everything.",
          "Possibly a fine vibration, not limited to my body.",
          "It was brief, but felt timeless in that moment, though I could still reference the before and after.",
          "After a few attempts, that worked briefly once.",
          "After months, I 'saw' the reality: no special state or sensation was needed.",
          "This led to 35 years of practice.",
          "I think it's a mental ability that I have strengthened with practice; at first it was very difficult, now I feel it's like gliding, although if I don't follow the preparation, the sensory perceptions, the rain of thoughts and desires will be an obstruction.",

          "I've had similar experiences, but never as profound, and never with that same audio track.",
          "'I' sat outdoors and looked at the surroundings.",
          "First I sat in the building, then outside in the garden with the same task.",
          "I followed Mind Illuminated's introductory steps: Motivation, Goals, Expectations, Diligence, Distractions, and Posture.",
          "My meditation experiences vary; some sessions have many thoughts and restlessness.",
          "The state reappeared in subsequent meditations, though less intensely, and recurs.",
          "In deep meditation, I detach my consciousness from my body.",
          "This also brings me back from the meditation in which I experienced several of these thought pauses.",
          "During a longer sitting meditation, the focus increasingly detached from all objects of meditation (breathing, body parts, sounds, thoughts, feelings).",
          "This occurred during a guided mindfulness meditation (audio only, no music).",
          "There was a Rapé ritual beforehand to support it.",
          "It was during a group session.",
          "In meditation I am one with everything, mind, body and the world.",
          "After practicing TM meditation for about 3 months, I had a very profound experience for me.",
          "My experience occurs during meditation and can be evoked through concentration.",

          "Not infrequently during sitting meditation I experience myself - seemingly quite independently of the degree of my concentration, also of the content of my sometimes lively active thoughts, or my pleasant or unpleasant feelings - as sunk into an encompassing space, or in other words: settled down on/in a ground, which however has no bottom, yet is quite secure.",

          "(Between all these things, however, most meditation sessions were rather boring, full of thoughts, sometimes even unwilling and strenuous.",
          "I also regularly practice yoga and a certain movement meditation.",
          "This is not the only experience of awareness of the mind itself, but it is probably the one which initiated a preference for practice does not separate awareness from Compassion and its essence is non-contrivance.",
          "It was my first experience of \"awareness\" in meditation.",
          "I had the experience during the evening talk (7 pm to 9 pm) of a 10-day silent Vipassanā retreat (I think it was the seventh day of the retreat).",
          "After the meditations, an experience of sensory impressions – very clear and very precise – and feelings and thoughts – very clear and very precise – but without any self-reference, without any personalized reference point.",
          "Furthermore, I had an experience of complete merging with a leaf that fell from a tree in that moment.",
          "I was not meditating.",
          "My experiences of this type arose mainly during the meditative practice of zazen, and had a rather transient quality and varying intensity, never reaching a completely \"ecstatic\" quality.",
          "For the experience I chose to report here, I had been backpacking for several months but maintaining a consistent meditation practice.",
          "The states occurred during practice in the sense of MBSR Body Scan, Open Awareness, but also during the exercise 'Experiencing Stillness' guided by Lama Yeshe Rabgiye from Insight Timer.",
          "The period of time I was in meditation (which seemed to catalyze it after some build-up from the retreat combined with immersion in the natural surrounds) lasted briefly (I had probably sat down to meditate for a mere 1-5 minutes) because I recall standing up from meditation shortly after the feeling begun (simply because it felt \"right\" to do so) and walking through the forest, feeling as though there was no separation between \"me\" and \"it\" (forest, other \"objects\" supposedly \"outside\" of \"me,\" which felt like fauserphic constructs intended for convenience only) still with this bouyant/weightless quality (bodily boundaries dissolved) and with every step rooted in peace, equanimity, joy, wholeness.",
          "The preparation is very important for me.",
          "The next day I repeated all the same steps (looking for the same sensation).",
          "It was during a Vipassana retreat in Spain led by Dhiravamsa.",
          "It does make a difference whether one chooses one practice or another; depending on this, the experience is different.",
          "When I then looked at the trees moving in the wind, I had the feeling of merging with them and the surroundings.",
          "Once I learn to instantly center myself, I can meditate and experience pure awareness anywhere, anytime—gathering herbs or cleaning lettuce; no preparation needed, 10-15 minutes at a time.",
          "My first experience of inner awareness happened shortly after learning the Transcendental Meditation technique.",
          "This can happen easily and often for experienced meditators, and spontaneously sometime for total neophytes.",
          "Since then I can very well withdraw into myself almost anywhere and anytime, meditate and also make \"contact\" with my surroundings.",
          "During this period, I was meditating between 30min up to an hour each day, which diminished over time when I moved back to the Netherlands.",
          "It was in meditation.",
          "But it was so unusual that I became afraid and stopped my meditation practices for years.",
          "It's not about the phenomenological experiences DURING meditation, I simply noticed that the practice gives me clarity and stability in everyday life, that's why I meditate regularly.",
          "I have never experienced it again in comparable intensity during meditation.",
          "All I can say is that things were still happening - the sounds of birds outside, the creaking floor in the meditation hall, the sight of the wooden floor in front of me (open eyes meditation).",
          "On the second-to-last day of an 8-day Zen retreat, I was suddenly overcome by a force, tears flowing, not from sadness but from a deep, overwhelming happiness (though that's not quite the right word).",
          "At some point, I felt my body again, thoughts and feelings returned.",
          "I think that the experience stopped when the bell rang and we slowly opened our eyes again.",
          "I've also had this in meditation (described in the questionnaire).",
          "The experience my answers refer to was a very deep experience in my consciousness, which I gradually reached during a meditation in which I increasingly felt or perceived that I was arriving at pure consciousness, that is, a consciousness without specific content, simply consciousness.",
          "I understood experientially (not intellectually) that I was born from the earth—that I was once these trees and moss—and would return to it, being temporarily human.",
          "I was in a room, with a beautiful view of a meadow and a tree.",
          "After meditation, I sat in a contemplative, relaxed state in the garden; everything was very light and softly drawn.",
          "I have just meditated, I am outside in nature, on the bank of a river and I am somehow still in a state of relaxation still gripped by the meditation.",
          "At the beginning of my regular meditation practice, I did experience the flashing of states of pure being and all-encompassing connectedness, but on a—as I later found out—completely different level of experience/with completely different depth.",
          "I think my first true experience of pure consciousness was during the birth of my first daughter.",
          "But these impressions were not limited to the place of their origin – the present wind and the trees around me.",
          "I practice Zazen.",
          "I started meditating in nature.",
          "Then for some period, I coincided with these grasses.",
          "I'm also aware of the description and practices for the third insight from the 9th Karmapa's book, and other Mahamudra texts.",
          "also experienced it with increasing serenity.",
          "It was as if during meditation there had been something I had always remained unaware of, an unconscious sense of striving for something, to not forget something, a background mechanism that kept checking, continuously trying to sustain something it would then immediately destroy by recognizing it as the state of pure awareness.",
          "In walking meditation: presence, clarity, deep joy, timelessness, deep connection with myself, nature and life as such, deep peace, a feeling of silence, interwoven with life, complete aimlessness, as if everything were in this moment at the same time, nothing is more important, deep gratitude, weightlessness with simultaneous conscious contact with the ground, happiness.",
          "Through these two daily meditations, I have been able to significantly reduce my medication intake for my high blood pressure.",
          "During meditation, a dissolution happens; the 'center of I' becomes fluid, sometimes dropping into the breath, sometimes merging with awareness.",
          "To my astonishment, the Arctic is alive: fish and polar bears...",
          "While meditating in a Buddhist monastery, I discovered an inner \"place\" where I can be as I am, without having to do or prove anything.",
          "Without inducing the described state through meditation, I was able to spend my life thought-free for several days.",
          "I experience an altered form of perception of people and things in everyday life, the permeability of everything, which then transforms into an all-encompassing stillness and peace in short moments of meditation.",
          "For a moment during meditation I felt one with everything else and blissful.",
          "It was after 5 days of meditating 5 hours a day at home with an online recording of a Shamatha retreat by Allan Wallace 2012.",
          "In sitting meditation: the feeling of wholeness, weightlessness, inner and outer stillness, deep peace, connectedness, arrival, light-filled, strongly slowed breathing, stillness, nothing is more important, carried by the breath, present.",
          "Before your mindfulness meditation gets deep, there is a monk that points out the selflessness of existence.",
          "While I do not know when in the practice the particular experience occurred, I distinctly recall a very unique experience that has not since occurred in my meditation practice.",
          "During a 25-minute meditation session, I spontaneously entered a state of boundless perception, feeling one with everything—pure, reflection-free perception in complete relaxation and wonder.",
          "I was meditating while waiting for my car at a car wash, staring out the window and simultaneously connected with my reflection as I expanded my field of vision and tried to look back at the meditator, and everything became one and separate from my thoughts.",
          "It took a few more minutes until I knew again how to think, how to walk.",
          "In between, I also did one of my meditation exercises.",
          "I would still like to meditate today, but due to very severe physical pain (dull pain after thigh amputation), this has unfortunately become less and less possible for me.",
          "But as I could function normally, walk back to my car and sat at a terrace ordering coffee, then this state slowly passed by.",
          "The meditating experience I had in mind while completing this I have described as a sudden and complete understanding of the concept of 'one taste'.",
          "The experience I was thinking of during the questioning happened spontaneously at a Buddhist retreat: I was waiting at the reception, completely relaxed and not practicing or thinking anything special.",
          "This happened on a bus journey.",
          "Sometimes even the individual impulses of the bigger plants and also the tendencies in the mind of the people around me.",
          "During a long monastic retreat, one morning I chose to eat my only meal alone, near a pond.",
          "Since I have meditated regularly every day for most of my life *(or rather \"transcended\"), the experience of \"pure consciousness\" is deeply rooted in my life feeling, so that I practically experience it 24/7.",
          "- In the 1990s I often participated in guided meditations.",
          "- And before I knew it, my spine also collapsed once, while a subtle force carried me weightlessly and straightened me up again.",
          "Just as I looked up at the crown of the tree, an apple fell directly onto my head.",
          "Reading about Vipassana meditation, I found the idea of viewing thoughts as fleeting bodily sensations appealing.",
          "I start with Anapanasati, but after an initial spaciousness (likely entering the 3rd Dhyana), I focus on 'space,' imagining myself meditating under a 'sky dome.'",
          "The most astonishing thing about this experience or this state (which lasted over 2 hours) was how normal it felt, in the sense of \"yes, of course, that's how it is\".",
          "Experience during a 10-day dark retreat: pure consciousness, bright, clear, connected with the experience of inner light—like in a dream—but not in sleep, but while awake meditating in the darkness.",
          "In a meditation retreat.",
          "Given the very positive results on both fronts, any experience of selflessness is just a bonus, and I would meditate even were such states not possible.",
          "A few occasions when I had the experience of listening without being a separate listener, usually during or just after meditating with eyes closed.",
          "Without smoking any weed.",
          "Occurred in a 6-day silent retreat during meditation.",
          "I am not aware of the meditation's beginning or incoming ending.",
          "This also happened for 5 minutes during another mindfulness retreat.",
          "For many months now, I have started the day with an exercise (following Loch Kelly) to train a pure consciousness (awareness) that is aware of itself, for use in everyday life.",
          "My clearest experience of pure consciousness was during a 10-day Vipassana Meditation Retreat, although the curious thing is that the experience did not arise during the period of formal meditation but during a rest period.",
          "Through many years of meditation (TM) my life has changed, everything is very simple and clear.",
          "In the end, I only get up with much gratitude, and I return to my daily tasks, and it feels like descending from a mountain, as if I had gone for a walk and returned to my routine.",
          "It sometimes arises completely unexpectedly and reminds me physically of an unexpected sudden chill.",
          "Okay, describing the state I'm in now which is quite easily attainable for me with meditation.",
          "Every time after Transcendental Meditation, I have a feeling that people look at me and smile at me and are friendly to me, although there is no particular reason to be friendly without reason.",
          "Afterwards, only determinations such as stillness or gentleness (still in meditation) and then good mood or refreshment (after meditation) come.",
          "I practice walking meditation.",
          "After the meditation, there remains joy and relaxation and presence, which makes it easier to assess what is appropriate now.",
          "If it is important to your research I can check in my notes to see if I have precise dates.",
          "Walking in nature and merging with it—very normal yet not.",
          "During meditation, I redirect attention to the self.",
          "I had various experiences of pure consciousness.",
          "After about 20 years of meditation practice, I can produce the state of pure awareness 'at the push of a button' within a few minutes.",
          "During meditation I came to a point where I was only aware of myself and felt how my body breathed and how the body moved with the breath.",
          "The question of whether this is physical, mental or neither seems difficult to answer.",
          "In a meditative state, it feels as though \"I\" don't exist anymore.",
          "Again and again I experience in meditation that I feel as one with God and God in everything.",
          "I've been meditating on and off for 15 years but really only daily for the last 18 months or so, so I consider my practice incredibly nascent, and I'm undertaking it more as a positive means toward better mental health and a less self-destructive life.",
          "My strongest experience occurred during a 5-day sesshin, on the last day.",
          "– I'm meditating, suddenly I have the feeling that my body has disappeared, has expanded infinitely and my mind is everywhere.",
          "Sometimes I'm very energetic afterwards, other days very tired.",
          "It was as if I were on another level and I differed from my fellow meditators, but nevertheless we were all connected to each other.",

          "After I became familiar with Vipassana meditation within a yoga training, I stopped getting annoyed when I was awake at night, but instead, lying in bed, I concentrated on the breath of air on my nostrils.",
          "Hard to describe.... Another experience, which was just yesterday: I was lying in the brine pool of a swimming pool on a kind of lounger and meditating a little 'to myself' (there was nobody else there).",
          "In meditation I experience a lot of light, boundlessness and bliss.",
          "I rested for the majority of the meditation session in observing consciousness itself.",
          "I worked with the Karma Clearing method on my karma and was able to dissolve what was probably important karma.",
          "Now I have this experience even with thoughts, or in daily life along with dynamic activity.",
          "I am very curious about the idea of connecting with that level of consciousness but not being able to maintain it in the hustle and bustle of daily life.",
          "During a retreat (contemplation), during a sitting meditation, I had an intense feeling of awareness.",
          "In the meditation before the actual experience there were instructions from off-stage such as: Don't waste your time.",

          "The meditations did not proceed uniformly; there were always large fluctuations.",
          "The experience of a thought in meditation is sometimes like a drop of water falling onto a very quiet surface of water and creating ripples.",
          "But even when the clarity of the experience is less, I feel how the body comes out of meditation (TM) strengthened and refreshed.",
          "Nevertheless, meditations on the retreat were uniformly deep, long and still, with easy access to 5th& 6th jhanas.",

          "The experience I referenced occurred during a short Zen retreat's final sitting periods.",
          "In another experience, while meditating, I suddenly grasped the existing 'ALL' WITHOUT foundation.",

          "And that was also the moment when the clever commentator tried to take over completely, and almost ruined it all: \"We have a completely wrong understanding of meditation, solitude, and renunciation!",
          "Since then, I've learned to 'lose my head' at will and other techniques (e.g., throwing my attention to a corner of the room and looking back), giving me the same wholeness/emptiness/fullness, eliminating the self and watching it reform as thoughts pattern.",

          "The last time I experienced a state of \"pure awareness\" was on a contemplative meditation and silence day.",

          "Bodily sensations were very clear, only completely different and not limited to the 'physical' body.",
          "It was a feeling of deep peace and quiet.",
          "I opened my eyes right after and the object before my eyes happened to be my son's stuffed toy he had left behind.",
          "It was like a trance, almost ecstatic, incredibly beautiful.",
          "Although it was dark, its extent was clearly three-dimensional, but at the same time I was aware that this space was a mental representation of my mind.",
          "In the experience of pure awareness, it felt as if I were simultaneously centered and very widely spread out.",
          "It was outside of me because I saw it through my eyes, but it felt completely different than usual.",
          "I had a feeling of boundless space.",
          "On the contrary - it was an intensive togetherness of everything.",
          "It was overwhelming and intimate, and above all, very beautiful.",
          "There were no more worries and fears.",
          "A feeling of being recognized and seen with goodwill—something that is always with me and permeates everything anyway—brought happily flowing streams of balm through my blood.",
          "The feeling of clarity and tranquility was immense.",
          "I became the observer again, the center of my experience, aware of awareness but not awareness itself.",
          "I felt completely boundless, merged with the whole, peaceful, fulfilled, connected with the One God.",
          "\"), everything became very simple.",
          "A non-physical space emerged within me, which increased moment by moment and in which the boundaries between the perceiver and the perceived object blurred.",
          "I was completely calm and peaceful, filled inwardly with a very deep bliss and the feeling that everything is in perfect order and will always be in perfect order.",
          "At some point, I then had the feeling \"Now,\" having arrived in pure consciousness.",
          "The image vanished; I felt great peace, present, without thought.",
          "It felt peaceful and alert.",
          "I experienced great peace, a stillness, and was completely awake.",
          "I experienced awareness itself.",
          "This also resulted in a distinct feeling of sublimity and that I can create my own reality and observe myself and my \"avatar,\" so to speak, simultaneously from the outside.",
          "I have answered the questions above having in mind a specific experience I had during a meditation some years ago: Everything was this perception of an endless space, like between planets, without light, but somehow bright, without anything in it, a complete nothing, but at the same time with all the potentialities in it!",
          "I am completely rested and fresh.",
          "It felt like I was standing a few meters away from an energetic representation of myself.",
          "It was a moment of lucidity and absolute understanding.",
          "The body felt like it dissolved and what was left was my awareness, being aware of itself.",
          "It was even somewhat like I felt myself moving forward in this space, like a spaceship in space.",
          "I also had the feeling of seeing the objects as if for the first time, with a renewed attention similar to that of children who look at things for the first time.",
          "I don't think I've ever been here before, but now, there are no distractions from the present moment.",
          "It was an experience of unity with everything.",
          "A feeling of lightness, self-evidence and absolute bliss flooded me.",
          "Everything felt fresh and alive, all embracing.",
          "The empty space shifted into a unified presence.",
          "Astonishing and joyful in the first moment, but at the same time very simple.",
          "Suddenly, I awoke to vast emptiness.",
          "I had never experienced such relaxation before.",
          "It lasted for an hour or so, but I felt truly at peace with the world.",
          "Overall, it was incredibly positive, and I regularly attempt to replicate it.",
          "Another experience was falling into an empty space...",
          "Every sensory detail was more vivid and present than during ordinary consciousness.",
          "I perceived the noises around me, but at the same time I was completely centered and within myself.",
          "My body was as if dissolved, the boundaries were no longer perceptible, simultaneously boundless and grounded.",
          "That is, all mental phenomena, including sensations, thoughts, emotions, memories, pre-linguistic murmurings, and even awareness itself, became clear AS mental phenomenon, essentially no different from each other, even though each was, if anything, MORE distinguishable from its neighbours than usual.",
          "Eventually, a deep feeling of all that I can describe as extreme pleasure arose that seemed to flow through me.",
          "I was perfectly calm, unaware if my eyes were open or closed.",
          "Light-filled, energetic, desireless, comfortable, vibrating was the experience of this relaxed, happy state.",
          "I felt contentment without thoughts of the past or future, only the present.",
          "In fact, they seemed to mutually fuel each other; as the light became stronger, awareness increased, and vice versa.",
          "It was a state of pure being, not particularly happy, definitely not unhappy either - that is a question that did not arise at the moment.",
          "It was easy, boundless and full of peace.",
          "My mind then broke open, all breath ceased entirely, and for the next few hours I bathed in an ineffable experience of mind mixing with space.",
          "My conscious experience was the moment where everything appeared.",
          "I could run the \"Goenka-buzz\" smoothly through my body and extend it beyond its boundaries.",
          "During this time, I perceived myself as completely detached from my thoughts and feelings.",
          "It felt like returning to a forgotten but familiar natural state.",
          "There was a subtle and completely undramatic positive feeling tone permeating this silent awareness, a very fine and non-sensational sense of wonder, of delight, and soundness.",
          "Suddenly, I saw the question 'why?'",
          "I was on day 8 of a vipassana retreat meditating in the hall when suddenly the boundary of my body dissolved and I was everywhere at the same time.",
          "When I focus on limitless space, my internal experience is peace, silence, nothing-totality.",
          "I don't know how to explain that I felt like myself (whatever that is) while also feeling like a camera observing myself.",
          "I no longer felt my body.",
          "Then, a larger undulation of the vastness itself joined it.",
          "I felt like a lonely spectator in an empty cinema who suddenly realized that he is not the main actor in the film he is watching.",
          "I live practically differently than before, in the feeling of separation.",
          "I was at peace and connected and in agreement with everything that could have happened.",
          "After this transition, I was in the center of an unfathomably boundless space that examined me from countless waking eyes – an unspeakably naked state.",
          "The sky was everywhere, and this perception changed the perception of all the other objects in the scene, as if they were inside something gigantic.",
          "It wasn't a sensation separate from a sound; it was consciousness—all of it.",
          "I was just closing my eyes and it sounds odd, but there really is not any other word in the English language that describes the experience except the sound of the word bliss.",
          "I felt a surge through my body and then an awareness encompassing my entire phenomenological experience.",
          "I cried tears of joy during and after.",
          "This laughter was so refreshing, so natural, that I fell in love with it.",
          "The great \"recognition\" and \"unity\"... unfortunately I haven't experienced it again in this form.",
          "And instantly there was a sense of total awareness.",
          "The feelings were mainly love and amazement and gratitude.",
          "The events around me were outside and at the same time somehow a part of me.",
          "My being was whole like perhaps it had never been and this was the greatest joy imaginable.",
          "During a meditation session, an infinite space opened up in my consciousness with which I merged.",
          "This expansion became so intense that I lost all body sensations and then all sensation of form and limitation.",
          "It was as if my gaze penetrated everything I looked at.",
          "The feelings were unlike anything familiar (fear, joy, etc.).",
          "An incredibly beautiful moment, an empowering feeling as a woman—letting go and being part of that strong female power of Mother Nature.",
          "The numbers gradually disappeared and the space expanded.",
          "It felt like I was observing myself from within and looking at something completely free and selfless.",
          "This was a very positive experience.",
          "The numbness of everyday life is gone, things feel fresh.",
          "A truly great experience.",
          "There was breath, visual information, acoustic information, the coldness of the floor.",
          "At the same time, there was a feeling of unity of everything that was perceived as present (\"unity with the world\"); this is not surprising, as there was no longer any difference or contrast between subject and object, past, present and future.",
          "At the moment of writing and remembering, the \"dissolution feeling\" connected with the experience is most intense for me now.",
          "I felt like a bodiless being at times while walking through the city.",
          "I also felt like the universe loved me and that I was completely safe.",
          "It had an absolutely hilarious quality to it also – the way I'd try to describe it is the realization that I'd spent all this time running around inside a tiny, compelling kaleidoscope looking for a doorway out, when in reality the kaleidoscope has no floor or ceiling.",
          "Pure joy that was there without me having formulated the thought of this feeling.",
          "There was just this knowing of sensations coming and going, no good or bad, just watching these sensations do their thing.",
          "The evening meditation bell rang at 5:00 PM—my meal untouched.",
          "Each thought or sound helps this \"space\" getting highlighted, as this appears to be the center (in a non-physical way), of everything... of every thought that appears, or sound from the surrounding appears in this space.",
          "It's like releasing my entire existence.",
          "The perception was crystal clear, the surroundings shimmered, and I became aware of the actual timelessness in the world.",
          "This experience was extraordinarily blissful and created a deep peace within me.",
          "I became aware of it without a thought, I was in the moment of perception, of breathing.",
          "As the thought of having such \"Space\", itself seems to have been coming from the same \"Space\", and the realization of it being reflective comes from the same place too.",
          "In retrospect, it was a completely disembodied experience.",
          "I turned my attention to everything arising—the pain, emotional qualities, and thoughts—and at the same moment, this state of the observer took over, and everything opened up.",
          "Wherever my attention went, objects would form—like a car, but encompassing every make, model, and color, each shifting and flowing.",
          "The willpower was extreme, uncompromising, violent, honest – never again false ideas/illusions.",
          "I had the experience of Peace in 1992.",
          "It was a stable, peaceful experience.",
          "My companion also noticed it and asked me what was going on.",
          "Unlike typical out-of-body experiences, I had no visual external perspective.",
          "Sounds and colors rushed in.",
          "The things I looked at had no meaning; they were simply there, and I could feel them.",
          "I saw my hands and felt like *I was* my hands, not just connected to them.",
          "The mental quality was like being absorbed in a pleasurable activity, like painting, where all thoughts cease.",
          "It was fulfilling!",
          "It feels 'neutral'.",
          "Everything was clearer and more distinct.",
          "It took place about 4 yrs ago and I'm not sure what kind of languaging I have onboarded since then, but I do think that the awareness of the roominess had no center.",
          "Everything was silent, and there was a lot of light.",
          "Sometimes a strong equanimity was also noticeable.",
          "The sensations were of total peace and well-being; I felt happiness and at the same time astonishment at being feeling what I was feeling.",
          "It was absolute peace, without this experience triggering any feeling, but that too was beyond any humanly known feeling.",
          "I experienced awareness of being, in space.",
          "I simply felt happy, whole, safe, one with God.",
          "Not burdened by the heat of the usual stories.",
          "All stage fright transformed into pure awareness and fell away from me as I felt myself stepping onto the stage.",
          "Apart from deep peace, there was nothing particularly euphoric or newsworthy about it.",
          "Everybody's anxieties, joys, issues, all aspects of their being, were totally transparent.",
          "Except that my whole world was completely turned inside out, it was, so to speak, still totally normal...",
          "It was beautiful, and for a little while, I didn't want it to end.",
          "I was blissful, at peace.",
          "I would describe the state of mind I was in at that time as \"milky\" or \"soft white fog.\"",
          "It was a very pleasant experience.",
          "I experienced a state of complete unity and was simultaneously aware of it.",
          "Initially frightening, it became cozy.",
          "I felt gratitude, awareness.",
          "It was fantastic to experience the raw power of Mother Nature.",
          "The connected sensations that I remember clearly, pleasant.",
          "Another experience particularly affected my heart; it was very active, very open, very touchable, very awake, and I was amazed that such a state even exists.",
          "I returned into the crystal-clear silence one more time, but the innocence was long gone and I decided to let it go and start my day.",
          "Feelings of peace, happiness, and 'everything is okay as it is' arose within me.",
          "It felt like 'I' had an infinite amount of space.",
          "I would describe both as experiences of deep unity, peace, and wholeness, in which the bottom fell out of my everyday sense of self with all its anxieties, psychological patterns, thoughts, feelings, etc.",
          "The leader was satisfied, the participants too; I had given an adequate answer.",
          "Sensations were heightened.",
          "Instead, a perception of a space emerged, which perhaps extended slightly beyond my body, but was still clearly defined.",
          "Though thoughts, feelings, and sensations arose, an increasing spaciousness emerged—ownerless and softly bright.",
          "However, this made me aware that I had a 'center' or 'essence' with this large, limitless body around it.",
          "My body awareness was very intense.",
          "Tactile and bodily sensations had a weightlessness or transparency, unlimited.",
          "My experience was pure joy from simply being.",
          "I've had similar experiences, but this one was the most beautiful.",
          "I was the boundless space, the space was me, there was no I and no more separation, no positive and negative, no light, no shadow, only complete, powerful emptiness and silence.",
          "I have experienced the feeling of infinite space and timelessness both in meditation and in sleep and waking states, and it is always accompanied by feelings of happiness and lightness.",
          "My body feels as if it is permeated by fresh spring water.",
          "I experienced profound stillness.",
          "My body felt nonexistent, then my mind 'expanded.'",
          "It was an experience of great connectedness with everything, an experience of unity with nature, with everything.",
          "This was accompanied by a feeling of freedom and wonder.",
          "It was a long-lasting experience of just being fully 'myself' in an open and undefended contact with my surroundings (which included a group of 20 people).",
          "As if the contrast were stronger than usual, as if the glasses had just been ultrasonically cleaned.",
          "The overwhelming feeling was that of connection to everything that is and perfect love.",
          "Surprisingly, I felt my skeleton, my bone structure and details of my internal body that I had never perceived before, it was surprising: like everything else around me, everything seemed new to me every second, with wonder.",
          "I was in a space that wasn't me.",
          "There was also the quality of wonder, awe, and simultaneously simplicity, of being invited to play.",
          "There was such profound peace and bliss.",
          "It entailed a heightened sense of unity, of being a part of all that was in the moment.",
          "After about 45 minutes lightning struck, the pain in my knee exploded from one moment to the next, I saw all the attention bundled in it flying in chunks through my inner universe and everything that these chunks hit was also blown away.",
          "Then I had a peak experience, feeling bliss at everyone knowing me deeply.",
          "It was only a short moment - which left a longing behind ;).",
          "It's peaceful, natural, effortless.",
          "It didn't really map on to any previous experiences I'd had so I couldn't really call it joy or pleasure or happiness in the traditional sense.",
          "I felt as if something had turned \"inside out\", as if nothing in my perceptual fields was as usual.",
          "I felt completely at peace.",
          "And since it was complete unity, I later asked myself which instance could even perceive this, because actually nobody was \"at home\".",
          "Then an infinite space opened up and I practically no longer existed.",
          "What I remember most, even now physically, is the feeling of indivisibility, there was no me and everything else, everything was one.",
          "Right afterwards I took a walk and to my left there was an incredibly beautiful sunset and to my right at the same time a rainbow and then I knew Nature was telling me the decision was correct.",
          "It was a sunny and warm day that smelled of flowers.",
          "I had the feeling of floating in complete contentment.",
          "It was pure joy without attachment.",
          "Initially, a feeling of euphoria and creative inspiration set in, which then turned into a feeling of harmony and happiness.",
          "This unexpected, effortless feeling lasted only a short time but was profoundly impactful, proving the reality of the oneness of all beings.",
          "My body schema no longer existed.",
          "It feels as if something has broken open, of which I no longer know where \"it is still breaking through\"... beyond everything that has been experienced so far.",
          "I was aware of everything I was feeling, but at the same time I was like disconnected from everything that was happening around me.",
          "There was no thinking at the time, just total ease and tranquility that had occurred really quite a few days into the retreat.",
          "For me, this space was an object of my consciousness, in which the objects of my sensory perception are placed.",
          "It was \"space-order-dissolving\".",
          "The perception that all people around held their breath, were one with me and looked at me.",
          "I also had the possibility of being within myself (looking at the events from my perspective) or stepping out of my body (looking at the events from a bird's-eye perspective).",
          "I'm completely dissolved in myself, knowing all this.",
          "Great happiness flowed through me.",
          "It was an experience affecting directly all senses and the mind at the same time, with enormous force.",
          "It was an experience of complete acceptance of whatever was happening.",
          "I was stunned, and wondered what had I been doing all these years, when unfathomable peace was available at any moment without the need for any effort?",
          "It was exhilarating; I was keenly aware of a self separate from my body and thoughts.",
          "It's as if I were a guard dog: all my perceptions seem heightened.",
          "A complete marvel at the perfection and beauty of God's creation infused my heart.",
          "The mood relaxed, positive and almost without desire.",
          "There was just now and here; my sense of self was the nebula.",
          "This Peace had come at a time when I was going through intense fear, helplessness and frustration.",
          "At the same time, I felt my body very intensely.",
          "It was what I would call the bliss of non-duality.",
          "I opened my eyes and saw the sky, the grass, my friend – I had the feeling that someone had cleaned my old glasses: it radiated through everything, even through the dust.",
          "It was immensely relieving and giddy.",
          "It was a feeling of great vastness, non-thinking, vibrant happiness, and freedom.",
          "Life became drama-free.",
          "Sounds and images are more intense, connected, and free of illusion.",
          "I saw some sort of galactic clusters while being suspended in darkness, but at the same time it felt as if my body was just everywhere; not scary at all, more like ecstatic, and, probably because there were no body sensations, I felt very relaxed.",
          "Later experiences were calmer, like diving into a still lake—still yet flowing.",
          "The experiences have been profound: clear, harmonious, perfect, filled with unconditional love for myself and the world, and oneness with everything.",
          "There was a quality of gentleness and wonder, not in any words or concepts, but more as a pervasive feeling of \"this is it, this is how everything truly is.\"",
          "My physical body faded away, as did my perception of external objects.",
          "The impression of disappearing, of no longer being visible, came over me (it wouldn't have surprised me if someone had said so later).",
          "This insight settled deeply, replacing the anxious seeking that drove me.",
          "I began to discorporate and spread in every direction.",
          "During kinhin, I felt yesterday, today, and tomorrow merge, followed by being sucked into a tunnel of indescribable peace.",
          "I also knew that I am also something \"bigger, from outside and above,\" watching myself how I am dreaming.",
          "I experienced a feeling of absolute agreement with everything that is.",
          "Then the same evening when I was listening to a lecture waves of bliss at every one of the words rippled through my entire being.",
          "And in that moment, it had me, and I chose the sadness, and the stillness was gone.",
          "The strongest feelings were amazement and awe.",
          "It was largely emotionally neutral but peaceful.",
          "I could see the people in the room, although I had known them for a long time, I saw them for the first time.",
          "All concepts were lifted, and I experienced pure being in harmony with everything.",
          "However, there was a sense of unity of all things, beings, and life, and a sense of love interwoven into the space, connecting everything.",
          "It felt like \"oneness,\" but without the usual feelings like love or bliss.",
          "However, I still knew that I was dissolved while I was dissolved.",
          "Several times as a very bright, weightless, vast state of complete stillness and vastness.",
          "It was the most effortless and 'simple' way of being, and there was a strong experience of being a crystal-clear vessel, fully capable of being of service for whatever might be needed at that time and place.",
          "I started perceiving my room as some sort of transparent sphere or bubble.",
          "For the first time in my life I was at complete peace with myself and the world around me.",
          "Time limits and spatial boundaries dissolve, although I feel my body and also my skin, but the body feeling feels quite permeable.",
          "My experience was based on a \"space of emptiness...\" Here there was nothing but pure emptiness, silence, connection, and the feeling of having arrived in the present.",
          "Motionless, I was feeling the body as dissolved vibration, had only a few thoughts and a great sense of surprised wonder.",
          "While listening to a wonderful lecture I felt completely settled.",
          "I had eyes that probably resembled an eagle's or something similar; I could see everything in the smallest detail; it was magnificent.",
          "The mind was fully awake and clear.",
          "I knew, if anything disturbed this Peace, it was my own reaction, which I could stop immediately by reverting to Stillness, so, how could it go?",
          "There was also visual and auditory clarity that accompanied it.",
          "I had the feeling that I cannot say where \"here\" actually is, because it is here... there was a feeling of physical falling.",
          "In any case, it felt like an inner fall, a plunge from a great height.",
          "It was as if everything was expanding, and the sensations were incredibly pleasant; I felt a great deal of lightness, harmony, and fullness.",
          "I don't remember much how I felt about my body or sense of self.",
          "It was of abstract space, feeling like enlightened awareness emanating from a constant centre.",
          "There was a general sense of awe and joy.",
          "A massive blue eye opened behind my eyes, changing colors as I moved through it.",
          "In spring 2002, after bad news from a doctor, the world felt incredibly vibrant and beautiful, and I felt deeply connected with everything.",
          "After becoming aware of physical sensations, thoughts, and feelings, a deep feeling of joy, timelessness, and happiness arose.",
          "I perceived everything in detail: the noises from the cars and the tram, the tingling of ants on my face, the lightness of my feet, the heaviness of the earth, my own thoughts – everything came together at once, everything fit perfectly – the inner and outer worlds had permeated each other.",
          "With eyes open, objects were present to me.",
          "I walked completely calmly towards the rushing cow—and it was so incredible—the cow simply stopped galloping in front of me, and I could simply touch and hold it—and there was this encounter, this feeling of not being separate from this cow; it looked at me so incredulously and was completely trusting—we were both in a totally different space, a different time, a different connection, and my body was sleepwalking but completely autonomous; it was a completely fearless, very peaceful situation—absolutely in this outer world and completely not of this world—everything was as if dampened by something soft, tender, light, as if packed in cotton wool—yes, perhaps the space really had a different density.",
          "My body was as if it didn't exist, belonging to the universe.",
          "It felt like being at the bottom of recognition.",
          "It was a feeling of incredible freedom and deepest bliss.",
          "I experienced a vast, boundless space, a unity of all.",
          "If someone got irritated or angry with me, I saw them with great compassion and did not have the slightest bit of defensive emotionality.",
          "Letting go of my desire to react, the entire bodily experience fell away, producing an intense flame from bottom to top, with strong amazement and intensity, almost destabilizing.",
          "Since I knew this, it no longer confused me, and I could simply observe.",
          "Second, I was able to access a mental space I called 'the silence' where insights flow freely, and I'm completely relaxed.",
          "It was overwhelming interconnectedness, bliss, peace, and harmony; a warm, safe, and hugged feeling of totality.",
          "This experience involved visual perceptions of my own body and my bodily activity.",
          "I had an extreme feeling of greatness and bliss.",
          "I opened my eyes and all the objects in the room were present as usual, but I saw them with a kind of transcendent clarity.",
          "There are few words to describe the experience itself, but the summary would be two words: absolute understanding.",
          "All my psychological patterns became totally transparent to me: I saw them cognitively but they had absolutely no emotional hold on me.",
          "Suddenly I was in a state of absolute stillness and peace that I had never experienced before.",
          "I had no strong emotions, only a feeling of deep peace, clarity and serenity.",
          "No sense of separateness, but at the same time, I felt like I am the center of a centerless universe.",
          "My body felt strange, yet free and open.",
          "It did not feel external to me, but rather like a state that I would be able to return to as the experience felt like it was drawn from me.",
          "My consciousness expanded to fill the room.",
          "And that the 'me' that was watching me was also of pure energetic composition.",
          "These kinds of experiences are accompanied by a very intense feeling of joy.",
          "My girlfriend and I were pumpkin picking; the weather and our mood were great.",
          "Emotion was positive.",
          "I was as much a part of the space as the bed I was sitting on and the lamp visible from the window.",
          "It was as if my body/my being was pixilated and dissolved into the rest of the pixels that make up the entirety of everything else.",
          "The \"mental space\" began to expand and became steadily larger.",
          "What touched me most was the purity of the experience – there was a feeling as if this were truer or more real than the normal, confused experience.",
          "I felt relaxed and amazed.",
          "I no longer feel my body, I no longer hear anything from my surroundings, I no longer know where I begin and end and where I am.",
          "I felt bliss, fully aware, relaxed, and full of energy.",
          "At that moment I started smiling and feeling an unexpected deep sense of joy.",
          "There was very little negative valence.",
          "I did my normal work in the office, but at the same time I was a witness to my actions.",
          "It has felt since then perceived, understood and appreciated by me.",
          "The energy was aware.",
          "For the space itself began to move, over me in two opposite circular movements, somewhat like if one takes a jar of marmalade, whose screw cap does not open, horizontally on one's lap, in order to screw it on with great effort with both hands.",
          "The feeling as if the mantra fell \"through me\" occurred.",
          "Suddenly, everything went quiet.",
          "Thoughts, sensations and emotions were present but felt fluid and seemed to emanate from my self which simultaneously felt at one with all that was.",
          "There was heightened alertness and full awareness.",
          "Looking into my eyes felt like looking at a chess piece—no subject or object, just what appeared.",
          "Instead, I take the rebellious boy into my arms, which leads to a feeling of deep self-connectedness and bliss.",
          "I was standing in front of an officer and suddenly came this oceanic feeling of oneness.",
          "I did not even worry whether one day this Peace would go away.",
          "I had many moments of solitude, infused with deep knowledge and wisdom.",
          "I had the \"feeling\" that I was the whole world and at the same time I was a silent witness to this \"feeling.\"",
          "There was great joy and astonishment at being without history, a feeling of this being the natural state—great liberation.",
          "I felt safe and secure.",
          "I felt an awareness represented by an orb of light within this infinite space.",
          "This feeling pulsed alternately with perfect stillness.",
          "There was a lot of clarity (consciousness cognizing itself) and a joy that lasted for several days.",
          "I've experienced both unity and periods of many thoughts.",
          "I felt a 'turning inside out,' like passing through a needle's eye, everything dissolving: bodily sensations, thoughts, emotions.",
          "I felt deeply one with the world and everything in it.",
          "In these moments, I became aware that my body was moving while 'I' could observe and perceive it and everything else.",
          "The overwhelming feeling of the present moment's completeness pervaded the experience.",
          "It was incredibly pleasant and pleasurable.",
          "Everything was vibrant, alive, peaceful, open, inviting, and joyous.",
          "Every cough, every sniffle in the room, everything is totally accepted and my sense of self is gone, no feeling of space and time, and yet I am walking in a circle.",
          "It also feels as if an inner split, a wound, is growing together a little.",
          "Rather neutral and curious, no longer so identified as before.",
          "It felt like boundless loving-kindness in eternity, and I was part of that love.",
          "With each sense, the world reappeared.",
          "All complications are gone during those moments.",
          "If serenity has a name, it was this relaxation.",
          "I felt a calm abiding compassion and my desire for anything was a faint bubbling that would drop away only to arise upon a jostling or another such movement.",
          "There was a unity of consciousness I'd never experienced; the lines between sensations, sights, sounds, emotions, and thoughts blurred into oneness.",
          "A feeling of unity, depth, and bliss arose, and above all, of freedom, infinite freedom.",
          "I felt the limits dissolving until I could no longer distinguish \"myself\" from the surroundings.",
          "My 'selfing' within the awareness was also wonderful.",
          "All thought stopped, and a great sense of mental clarity and a precious silence descended.",
          "It was a feeling of boundlessness and deep peace.",
          "There was absolute silence and peace.",
          "Vibrations gathered into a nebula in front of my awareness.",
          "This experience was surprising insofar as I had almost disassociated myself from my body (the main actor in the film) (\"That's not me at all!\").",
          "I became the space, so to speak.",
          "A kind of bright, open space... at some point there was a huge, brown Buddha statue with a multi-rowed pink pearl necklace, positive feelings appeared, happiness, joy, lightness and with that also again a feeling of my body, my existence.",
          "It was a wonderful atmosphere.",
          "Everything felt silent, crisp, beautiful.",
          "Connected with this was also a strong feeling of fearlessness.",
          "My body dissolves into a micro-foam of impermanence, zooming into the fractal edge of present which endlessly unfurls fern-fronds of scintillating *now*-fuzz.",
          "Most impressive was the experience of unity and the associated detachment from physical boundaries.",
          "I was still in my room, but I no longer knew whether I was the whole room or just a fraction.",
          "I could no longer distinguish between my body and the surroundings.",
          "Floating in Cosmos must feel a bit like this.",
          "Then, being 21, I wondered what would happen if the world came back.",
          "I feel disconnected from a sense of self, connected to everything and everyone.",
          "It was, however, undeniably positive, both light (unburdened) and wondrous at the same time.",
          "Although I haven't experienced this absolute bliss, I am at peace with it.",
          "There was a feeling of contentment and calm, and yet tremendous energy, as if a channel had opened up in my mind.",
          "This was more than the usual Sati, it sounded like a master with personal instructions.",
          "I could not see any image of my body or my surroundings.",
          "Everything visible and audible became direct, unseparated, not distinct from the perceiving mind.",
          "From this state I returned with the awareness (now also visually) of being the whole universe, then a particle, and again feeling a body.",
          "In any case, since then I can easily and almost at any time enter this delicious silence.",
          "My heart became warm and full.",
          "Emotions were neutral but leaned towards a spectrum of positivity and inner contentment with peace.",
          "The experience went from the beautiful harmonious surroundings to a deep experience of bliss that is endless.",
          "It was pure perception and wonder.",
          "It was peaceful, free and flowing.",
          "My person/my body was no longer there, everything was just light.",
          "It was also a feeling of recognition.",
          "I felt blessed.",
          "There was total equanimity, and it was perfect; there was no need to \"come back\".",
          "It was pretty cool.",
          "That morning there was a complete absence of fear, a state of complete freedom and all possibilities.",
          "The experience was overwhelming and natural at the same time.",
          "Suddenly, there was only seeing, as a verb without a subject.",
          "It felt like a puzzle piece that completed a picture.",
          "It got the attention it always wished for.",
          "The emerging space is reaction-free, like a pause.",
          "It was crowded and everyone around me took on a flowery quality.",
          "Even the inner activity of my organs was perceptible with extreme intensity.",
          "I moved/flew or rather diffused through the vacuum between them.",
          "The interconnectedness was more significant than individual elements, which faded into a higher synthesis, losing their independence...",
          "My concentration and inner clarity were strong, I perceived sensations on all sensory levels clearly and precisely.",
          "I was very equanimous.",
          "After my thoughts had drifted away, I felt an optically and acoustically empty, boundless space far removed from any sense of time and with regularly flowing vibrations \"through me\".",
          "And so I feel again: the accesses and windows to my experience are open again.",
          "Nothing could be doubted, everything was truth and love and a feeling of arrival.",

          "I feel totally content.",
          "Suddenly a strong feeling of insight came over me.",
          "In confronting a person, I could no longer distinguish whose eyes I was looking into, mine or the other person's.",
          "Suddenly everything feels still.",
          "The air was clear, the sun setting.",
          "There was also an equanimous joy - not coarse/rugged, but a subtle yet pervasive equanimity with positive intonations.",
          "Emotionally pleasant, but not euphoric, rather amazed, \"wow!",
          "When the fear was greatest and I thought I would now have to drown, I could suddenly breathe freely underwater, in this element, which felt as much like air, only denser.",
          "It was fearless and liberating and left behind something like a feeling of \"this is immortal.\"",

          "I felt free and carefree, completely aware of myself.",
          "Then, calm returned, with strong identification with the space/ground of the experience.",
          "There was great joy, lightness, and a feeling of floating.",
          "I was in a state of total awareness, part of an infinite ocean of light.",
          "Deep within, I was one with my experience, though the observer remained in the background.",
          "At the same time, this space was aware of itself.",
          "Profound joy and equanimity that was not dependent upon thoughts.",
          "I realized, knew beyond doubt, that what I was experiencing was the grace of direct knowledge of the essence of things, and I realized how blind I had been, how I had been looking the wrong way, overlooking the most obvious, not seeing what was directly in front of me, waiting to be discovered, so obvious, but I had always overlooked it.",
          "In any case, I rested completely within myself.",
          "It was a state of infinite peace.",
          "A feeling of ever-increasing depth arose, which intensified more and more, it became brighter and brighter.",
          "I was no longer overshadowed by it, but only a silent witness to it.",
          "Some of the details are fuzzy (I don't remember the minutia of every single bit of the transition indoors) but everything felt effortless, peaceful, whole, as it should be, etc.",
          "Quite naturally, I resurfaced: everything shone new, fresh, and unused.",
          "In the center stood the self-resting recognition!!",
          "I was completely feeling my feet and the stairs, anxious thoughts were completely gone.",
          "My mind felt vast, but not in a physical, out-of-body sense.",
          "There was no longer really an inner center that observes, but just \"pure observation.\"",

          "It was a very pleasant experience, accompanied by an inner smile.",
          "The mood during the experience was deep satisfaction and unshakeable serenity.",
          "The events were not extraordinary, the perception was flowing and connected with a feeling of satisfaction, happiness and free from any doubt.",
          "There was a visual centre to the experience, but only because that's where light met the eyes.",
          "My body was there, fine, flowing.",
          "From within the empty space, a wave of light (like a sine wave) undulated before me.",
          "There was also an element of fear, because it feels quite groundless, and that is not something we intuitively like to experience.",
          "It was peaceful and it felt like 'me' who is freed from all conceptualizations, fears, desires, etc.",
          "This was followed by a state of deep peace, tranquility and absolute love.",
          "The realization, connected with a feeling of happiness, that \"the whole world is within\" did not impair my daily life or my dealings with other people.",
          "This was so obvious, yet I'd never noticed before.",
          "It was also very nice to simply have some peace and inner peace in my head.",
          "I was not aware of having/being a body but could feel that I was also part of the limitless space, filling it and expanding into it entirely.",
          "Observing this conjures a slight smile on my lips.",
          "What was happening was enough; the mind had calmed down.",
          "I believe that the experience was infused with a sense of calmness, but I think describing it in any valenced terms (i.e., positive or negative) would be inappropriate.",
          "It was a moment of sudden realization.",
          "Then, awareness became the center and periphery.",
          "In addition, a feeling of inner contentment and acceptance arose.",
          "When I opened my eyes, it was as if a film/a coloration consisting of concepts, thoughts, and evaluations had been removed from the outside world.",
          "That the sound I was hearing from a nearby refrigerator were no different than sensations.",
          "The earth on which I otherwise live and the universe were inside this bubble, I outside in a kind of vacuum.",
          "It was a very pleasant experience.",
          "My thoughts became still and gave way to a state of clarity, peace, bliss.",
          "The watching 'me' simply observed the watched 'me' with calm and fascination as the watched 'me' simply existed quietly in a perfectly still state.",
          "It was part amazement and excitement, and part recognition that I'd set off from where I had just been that drove the awareness.",
          "My awareness spread in boundless directions.",
          "As described, I felt connection, awe, and oneness.",
          "I had the feeling that I no longer existed as a person.",
          "It's the best experience I've ever had.",
          "- The space opened up by itself and revealed itself to me.",
          "The temperature was comfortable and it was quiet, except for some occasional wind.",
          "And a subtle feeling (no thought) of this is right.",
          "The whole world was completely simply logical and clear, embedded in this luminous, fragrant, sweet silence.",
          "It seems to grow ever larger.",
          "- My mind rocked like a nutshell on the high seas in the highest waves.",
          "During the experience I was calm, quiet, hardly emotional, liberated, everything seemed very clear and rather a bit cool to me.",
          "Everything felt slow and calm.",
          "Initially, I feared dissolving, but my body is now accustomed to it, knowing it will return to the 'normal' world.",
          "I lost all sense of being the agent of action and perception, instead feeling myself as identical with these things.",
          "Since then I feel truly free!",
          "My body was very relaxed, my mind awake and without thoughts, emotionally I was moved and tears flowed.",
          "Afterwards, the tension released and a deep stillness and connectedness emerged.",
          "A panoramic vision of the room continued like a giant centipede.",
          "Afterwards, I felt very relaxed.",
          "This I seemed to be bodyless and boundless.",
          "All my sensory perceptions became plastic, sharply contoured, heightened, and I was simultaneously detached from perceptions and sensations.",
          "They were moments of pure life, the fullness in the absence of everything else.",
          "I was aware I knew it, but I felt fascinated by how it was, the colors, the objects, the fact that it existed and that I was there.",
          "The state had a clear sense of deathlessness, and put living beings' constant struggle for survival in a whole different perspective.",
          "I was completely relaxed and left the house.",
          "During a meditation, I fell into a very vast, open, dark space that felt boundless and very, very still.",
          "It was more like a strong feeling of intimacy with oneself.",
          "There was a strong sense that the other's face was my own (like looking in a mirror) and a deep sense of tenderness and gratitude for that face.",
          "I was in a deep, black space without any boundaries.",
          "When that had subsided, I was completely calm, an absolute peace/stillness within me.",
          "As soon as I sat in the car, my surroundings completely dissolved.",
          "I felt my body and it was all clear and simple and there, there were no more blockages, obstacles, ambiguities, everything was open and so simple.",
          "The sense of hearing returned first, with the perception of the singing bowl.",
          "In contrast to inside, there was movement in the outer space (wind, insects, birds etc.)",
          "It was a blessing which didn't last long and was not obvious to my friend, but which made an indelible impact on my awareness.",
          "From this point on, I could no longer physically perceive my body, even though I tried to focus my attention on individual body regions or fingers.",
          "but I basked in it and enjoyed it.",
          "There was no uncanniness.",
          "If ever a thought or feeling arose, it was immediately surrendered back to where it came from.",
          "The sadness and burden of my soul had completely disappeared and no longer played a role.",
          "I also had the impression that my peripheral visual field was wider and more encompassing.",
          "I have experienced vast, non-centered timeless space and sometimes light and sometimes pure black or color but can really only put inadequate words to the experiences in retrospect.",
          "For a moment, there was only a space of experience/perception, in which I form the center (but not in a spatial sense) and which is the same when I sit at home.",
          "Had a sense of (just) being aware, awake.",
          "The concept of passing time was absent and the experience was definitely positive.",
          "In the bathroom, holding a seriously ill friend, I felt boundless oneness, no time or space, just peaceful oneness including the here and now.",
          "The experience was relieving, like taking off a tight shoe.",
          "It was as if I became detached from myself, but not bodily or emotionally.",
          "Everything becomes vast.",
          "This took a little while, then I somehow let go of my control, and dissolved, as I felt it.",
          "As if I could feel every little part of my body.",
          "There was a sense of space and consciousness both outside and within.",
          "I felt a bright cheerfulness that spread in waves upwards and out of me.",
          "It also took away my fear of death, since I have been convinced ever since that this consciousness continues beyond death, that it is indestructible.",
          "Attention floated freely in space between the different mind objects.",
          "There was deep, abiding acceptance of the world and myself within it.",
          "It was connected with a feeling of fullness, or wholeness, or perhaps emptiness - I wouldn't know how to tell them apart in the situation - very blissful.",
          "Visually, I don't remember seeing anyone or anything, but I was suddenly in a universe where communication was instantaneous and unobstructed between people.",
          "It was as though I was absorbed by the world which I had been focusing on so intently that I ceased to observe objects anymore but instead was at one with the environment as a whole.",
          "Afterwards, I could only tell her that I felt completely existent and completely non-existent at the same time.",
          "It was an experience of non-dual union that felt natural and extraordinary, yet it occurred within ordinary mind.",
          "The \"giving\" and the \"taking\" felt very intentional... like something intelligent was providing me with a glimpse of something important.",
          "I can do no more—so I have peace already.",
          "It felt like making contact with something/touching an inner quality that had always been there.",
          "However, the garden was remarkably silent and this caught my attention and led me to notice that nothing was wrong.",
          "This brought a peaceful, calm mood.",
          "The experience was more peaceful and pleasant.",
          "Everything seemed to originate in my hands; from there, this sensation grew.",

          "The eyes opened.",
          "I hardly perceive my body anymore.",
          "Suddenly, I saw the room I was in from a bird's-eye perspective.",
          "I felt a lightness, peacefulness, vastness and a radiance, a floating and at the same time a presence.",
          "So the perceiving came to the forefront, so that the observer (me) and the observed intertwined and were experienced by me as a unity.",
          "I had no perception of my body.",
          "There was intense focus, feeling incredibly powerful, energetic, and good.",
          "I was in an infinite, shapeless, colorless space.",
          "I was looking at my own body and experienced myself AS the seeing of the body – as the mode through which my body was given.",
          "As if I completely dissolved, all physical boundaries blurred; no separation between inside and outside.",
          "In this particular experience, however, only the space was present as the object of consciousness.",
          "I was not anxious or afraid; my worldly worries seemed insignificant.",
          "This feels like a revelation, but later, looking back, it also seems very obvious.",
          "I simply was, totally attentive and totally calm.",
          "This also enhanced my intuition.",
          "I only had the feeling that it was wonderful.",
          "In contrast to 1, here I was happy, more emotional in the perception of the delta from the previous storms of thought to a \"non-feeling.\"",
          "However, the body or space appears within it—completely relaxed.",
          "That was a very beautiful feeling.",
          "It was a good, positive and empowered feeling, without fear.",
          "All inner voices ceased.",
          "The bodily sensations are as light as all other sensations (auditory and visual) and therefore a rather space-equal, expansive quality was perceived, in which the body is no longer at the center.",
          "There was spacelessness and weightlessness, lightness.",
          "Suddenly I felt completely one (united) with my participants.",
          "Fear and at the same time something like awe.",
          "I had no awareness of my body or the external environment.",
          "It was simply indescribable.",
          "It was a sense of ease, lightness, expansion, and the most natural way of being I have ever experienced.",
          "Expanding further to merge with the room.",
          "As my mind opened, so did the world.",
          "I suddenly felt my tension in my body and had the insight: everything is as it is, quite natural.",
          "I had this sense of awe, energetic radiance, sense of connectedness with everything, no good, no bad, no self, no time – just witness and in awe of the miracle of my own consciousness – like seeing the sun for the first time.",
          "The great advantage was that I didn't get tired at all.",
          "Only 'space' remains, with slight fluctuations and occasional mental events.",
          "My five senses manifested one by one.",
          "At that moment, I felt a deep sense of unity and oneness.",
          "As I went through my body with my attention from top to bottom, I perceived my whole body as a tingling, vibrating something.",
          "The sense of living in a world that I experienced (this is still my default mode of being) fell completely away and instead there was only the experience itself.",
          "There was no effort, a feeling of great naturalness and well-being, as if I were experiencing the actual, original quality of the mind.",
          "At that moment, it felt to me as if it were the most essential thing I had ever experienced.",
          "Trying to capture it returned me to dual subject-object awareness.",
          "Acceptance of not being 'the thinker' was far more accepted and clear than usual.",
          "After the experience, I was able to tap into two different aspects: first, I could create the experience of the white space for myself and anyone I was communicating with.",
          "The sensation of conscious space was also amazing.",
          "The space surrounding me was very clear and distinct, rather boundless.",
          "It became clear to me that these other points were souls or soul parts.",
          "The power of mental torture and conflict so often unbearably present in those days was completely pacified.",

          "I felt warm, very present, connected with everything around me.",
          "The experience felt like pure peace.",
          "There was no inner dialogue, the predominant emotion was equanimity and great happiness.",
          "I felt heavy, warm, and expanding, totally at peace and still.",
          "I almost cry with joy when I think about it.",
          "I identify this space with pure consciousness.",
          "I no longer feel my body.",
          "I felt an unusual calm and peace, and at that moment there was no desire even to maintain that state.",
          "Returning to subject-object awareness, I felt there was no point in navigating space in that manner.",
          "I am reassured and relieved.",
          "A change occurred—lightness and freedom.",
          "I was completely calm and peacefully relaxed.",
          "Something opened up inside me and everything was good - on a deep level everything was connected, there was no longer an I, but only an emptiness (a space) in which there was joy, peace, stillness, fullness and depth.",
          "It was exhilarating and fulfilling, like being reborn in the dream, experiencing everything anew.",
          "We were in warrior 2, and the teacher guided us to notice sensation, absent quality or commentary.",
          "I therefore thanked that mischievous mosquito infinitely.",
          "I was weightless in the space of infinite possibilities, a nobody in the blackness of the universe.",
          "It felt peaceful and true, yet I'm unsure how I felt.",
          "There was a clear sense of being centered but the center as quite empty, like an electron with no mass.",
          "Everything is incredibly clear.",
          "There was no longer any feeling of needing to get someplace or something.",
          "I felt aware, it felt like whatever thoughts I had seemed like they flew through a stream in an open environment, without any restrictions.",
          "It is like taking a thimble of water from the ocean of wisdom; however, I continually felt gratitude, awe, and was completely void of the emotion anger.",
          "I felt awake like never before, precisely as if I were seeing things for the first time.",
          "It was just extremely still and peaceful.",
          "There is something \"equanimous\", that is to say that if a positive emotion or joy appears it is in fact after the experience of pure consciousness - once a feeling takes a certain strength, a thought takes place, or a sensation; it is the return to awakened but more traditional consciousness.",
          "I had the feeling of being exactly where life wanted me to be.",
          "I experienced a state of perfect stillness and boundlessness.",
          "I travel through space, meeting different lifeforms, communicating directly and seeing their insides.",
          "But I could observe myself from the outside, like another person.",
          "There was no time, I had no body, yet I had a presence that distinguished me from the white, yet I also was part of the white space.",
          "I was this space and this space was pure awareness.",
          "There were no fears, only a little happiness, a smiling feeling it was ok and would be ok in the future.",
          "He described my experience perfectly.",
          "But this is not an ordinary pride, it is like a knowledge of inner strength in a confrontation that requires no action, but is free from any expectation and unfolds very spontaneously.",
          "The knot was resolved immediately, and the suffering inside me related to her unintelligible loss stopped, not just then but forever; I finally found myself accepting, forgiving, letting go.",
          "I am lucid and fly (numerous actions and events that I will not describe here) into space, namely to the center of the galaxy, because I want to know what is there.",
          "Just welling from the body.",
          "Days later, psychological thoughts ceased, only practical ones remained.",
          "The clearest feeling was rather that perhaps it acted and I watched.",
          "Since then, I've felt deep trust and no longer fear.",
          "But most of all, it invoked a strange sense of fearlessness, of intimacy with life and beyond.",
          "I wasn't noticing something, but it was pure noticing; I wasn't questioning something, but it was pure questioning.",
          "Then came the physical sensation of 'shrinking', as if my coat suddenly became too big and I was shrinking smaller and smaller into it.",
          "It was very pleasant.",
          "To this was associated an inner sense of energy, and a sense of liberation, of relief.",
          "I didn't feel a contracted version of a self, but rather an openness, boundless space.",
          "At an emotional level there was a sense of great awe.",
          "Time, space, and bodily boundaries dissolved, but I perceived my surroundings clearly.",
          "Resting there, there was a sense of profound quiet.",
          "Now that I think a bit more about the experience, I have to say that I did in fact experience some kind of unity.",
          "I felt like I just 'was' and my awareness just observed.",
          "- And before I knew it, my heart leaped and I bathed in a sea of equanimity and boundless love.",
          "I experienced a vast, supportive stillness, infinite peace, and unconditional love.",
          "At the same time, I felt reverence and gratitude.",
          "I felt a deep sense of love - for myself, other people, plants and animals, and the universe.",
          "I distinctly remember amplified sounds, a buzzing in my ears, attention immersed in sights and sounds, an absence of thought, and a sense of peace and joy.",
          "Then awareness turned to look inwards and there was no longer a division between \"self\" and \"space.\"",
          "Physical arousal remained, but fear vanished.",
          "Main feeling I had was just of seeing everything as it truly is.",
          "There was a great calm and concentration with self-awareness in the present moment and a soft letting go of EVERYTHING (thoughts, ideas, feelings, etc...).",
          "In retrospect, it's paradoxical to describe, but all feelings existed simultaneously/or alongside each other and did not exclude each other.",
          "I felt warmth, security, simplicity, originality, timelessness, fulfillment.",
          "Increasingly, I felt deep peace, until one day complete silence and a pleasant light spread within me.",
          "I think I also found my body as being very interesting.",
          "I am content.",
          "I dipped my legs in the water, I was very awake and very present.",
          "It's hard to describe, but I felt as much myself as my neighbor or anyone else.",
          "In doing so, headaches disappeared and a deep inner peace spread.",
          "Deep peace and calm overcame me; I felt my body present, yet light and unburdened.",
          "My thinking stopped, stood still, and everything disappeared for a short moment from my mind.",
          "Sounds were perfect and wonderful.",
          "This included 8 days of deprivation of sensory stimuli (hearing, seeing, touching, tasting only through the regular intake of a nutrient solution).",
          "I was not just the sounds I could hear, but the awareness of sound traveling from a body all the way to the corner of the room, and all the places in between.",
          "I felt incredible vastness, as if connected to another sphere.",
          "My body boundaries almost completely dissolved and an infinite, bright space became experienceable.",
          "I was bliss.",
          "I was wide awake and particularly perceptive with regard to the sounds from the surroundings.",
          "What then happened with, in me or around me was completely beyond my control.",
          "Immediately, the whole world seemed to collapse in on itself and I was this world, water, mountains, lake... myself - I perceived everything simultaneously.",
          "I want to say I felt peaceful, but it was more like a cessation of thoughts and bodily sensation and the replacement of that with a feeling of wholeness.",
          "I was in an inner space that resembled a cathedral.",
          "- And this pulsation also felt like a love flowing through the whole body/mind.",
          "Familiar songs evoked no memories or thoughts; even the way to the supermarket felt fresh each time.",
          "Earlier: an experience of Oneness with a girl that I saw from riding in a train, with eye contact... just happening, the deep sense that I could have been her, that I was her, that I am her; oneness, undividedness, common humanity.",
          "During the fading period it became very amusing/pleasing that the contents of the experience (the world) moved.",
          "This entire scene felt like it played itself out inside my consciousness, not in any physical space that I could touch in this reality.",
          "Soon the emotion came, tears of joy flowing.",
          "I refer to it now as the lucid void.",
          "The world of the divine was opened to me, shifting the real world to a more relative plane.",
          "I felt light within me, and that's when it all began.",
          "Its good to be 'refreshed and released'.",
          "I perceived everything around me very clearly, clearer than before.",
          "It was as if I were looking the sky \"in the eyes\" and for the first time I realized how immense it was, how impossible it was for me to look at it all.",
          "As a result, my fears, worries and other important things simply became unimportant.",

          "In experiences in the non-dreaming state, I often had the perception as if an observer, but not a physically contoured observer, but rather \"the observing\" is simply taking note with participation of what is currently appearing in the area that I otherwise call \"in me\" or also \"I\", all thoughts, feelings, emotions, etc., that I could then switch again to a more controlling active observer, who could specifically direct certain ideas and focusings considered helpful by this instance.",

          "Here's a report of the above category, in everyday activity: As I type these words, I can listen to the sound of the keys, reflect on what I am writing, and also tune my attention to the fundamental wakefulness of awareness that both receives and makes possible all these perceptions.",
          "Sometimes it becomes immediately conscious in the \"appearance\", as if the sun rises and shines through the closed eyelids.",
          "There simply was no usual experience of sleep at all, just constant wakefulness without the sensation of time while I was asleep.",
          "The result of the solution was 'wakeful presence'.",

          "Experiences of pure awareness in NREM sleep, as described in the answers to this questionnaire, with one caveat: the question about the presence of self is not specific enough, i.e., autobiographical, core, or body-based self were absent, but the pure awareness was not someone else's awareness nor some subtle object/state I was aware of, as in jhana.",
          "Also during sleep and dream phases.",
          "It might be worth mentioning that I have had numerous experiences of awareness of the sleep state over the years and that I think these are meditation-related.",

          "I then remembered - in the dream - the instruction of a friend, in the lucid state no longer to participate in the activities, I sat down in the dream and questioned everything I saw in the dream existentially (This is only a dream) and meditated in the dream.",
          "And dull and awake at the same time.",

          "A feeling like being awake while sleeping or sleeping while awake.",
          "The transition from a normal to a lucid dream brings the same feeling of heart warmth with it, but is less characterized by clarity than the transition from normal waking consciousness to lucid consciousness.",
          "Between sleeping and waking there are \"moments\" that for me are absolute well-being – completely natural on all levels –",
          "I don't actually remember falling asleep, but I do remember going blank and realizing I wasn't paying attention to what the teacher was saying.",
          "I realized that the dream must be a dream because I found an inconsistency in the depiction of the space in which I found myself.",
          "I can only delimit the experience against the \"normal\" waking state as if in everyday life I see the world almost literally through invisible glasses.",

          "The experience of freedom of action, e.g., flying or being able to save oneself from danger, is also a pleasure but not rapture; not a transcendent state of consciousness, but everyday consciousness in dream reality, to which otherwise the more primitive dream consciousness would belong.",

          "Then I realized that my body was asleep.",
          "It felt like a state I could easily have fallen all the way out of, back into full wakefulness, but instead, I landed in a vast state of pure awareness on the way.",

          "My experiences have been in a wakeful state and have been characterized by a stable and extended felt sense of being aware of being aware in that particular place and time.",
          "I tried to glide into a dream while awake and experienced this moment of awareness in the intermediate state between dream and reality.",
          "During deep sleep, I can scan into my brain physiology and into my eyes from a point between the eyes and feel the energy in the body going up to the head chakra and I do a big jump.",

          "I am lying in bed.",
          "After experiencing it for who knows how long, I started waking up in my bed.",
          "I was confused, made sure I was awake (-I was wide awake) and that the light wasn't coming from the environment I was in.",
          "I glide into a state that I cannot classify as sleep or wakefulness: I feel my whole body very intensely and in its entirety, manifold bodily sensations.",
          "I awoke clearly in a room, this awakening felt absolutely concrete and real (but as I later realized, I was still in a dream!).",
          "Dreams appear and disappear.",
          "Having such perceptions while knowing it was a dream projection is what I believe is 'pure awareness,' though I disagree with the description; it implies a hierarchy.",
          "The experience I have been answering on the basis of was almost dreamlike, but while I was still awake.",
          "The moment of switching then occurs spontaneously, sometimes immediately when closing one's eyes, sometimes not at all; in any case, with increasing practice more regularly and under good conditions intentionally triggerable.",
          "This caused a range of feelings—nervousness, control, a breakthrough—with a desire to both fully experience the dream and avoid waking.",
          "But the dreams also changed during the dark retreat, and the transition between wakefulness, meditation, sleep, and dream became more conscious.",
          "Waking state: Used in survey: long period of absolutely no sense of past or future.",

          "I know states of deep rest with simultaneous absolute wakefulness.",
          "Other changes to the dream, such as making people appear, were easier.",
          "This experience of witnessing now also happens during most of the time of sleeping and dreaming.",
          "2) In dreams, I'm fully awake and autonomous, doing what I want.",
          "2. in a longer phase with little sleep, which resembled a dream state.",
          "When I was little, I sometimes dreamed very vividly, I dived into the water and saw the water surface above me.",
          "The experience itself happened as I was physically asleep.",
          "I felt pure awareness watching (being aware of) myself dreaming...and there was some fluidity, hovering - between each other...how I dream.",
          "The experience began later, after I'd drifted off and started hearing the chime in my sleep.",
          "I'm sure the light didn't come from any external source and that I was completely awake.",
          "Shortly afterwards I woke up, this time really and I could remember everything down to the last detail, the 1st dream, the lucid state, the pure awareness, the black endless space, the awakening in this room, these strange beings...",
          "For a certain time I was like sleeping but awake and I felt completely one with my surroundings, had no needs, but also no emotions, simply relaxed without wanting anything or thinking.",

          "It was during a lucid dream.",
          "A recent, powerful experience was \"infinite simultaneity\" while fully awake.",
          "Apart from black voids between dreams and 'tunnel journeys' to new dream scenes, I have not experienced anything similar, such as Clare Johnson describes her 'Lucid Light' dreams.",
          "The setting: I was woken up by my young children several times a night for years.",
          "In my dream, I was frantically trying to turn on a light switch when I heard the chime.",
          "A dream in the Arctic.",
          "By active alertness I choose where to put my attention and thoughts and emotions hold no interest any more other than a reminder that I've left the present and so to come back again.",
          "My strongest experience was in a dream state.",
          "I am then completely awake, very present, and at the same time I get the impression that something in me is observing me and at the same time is one with me and sometimes also with my surroundings.",
          "During my MBSR educational training last November, I had a very strong experience of a lucid dream.",
          "Another more general experience over time is that my sleep is lighter and I remember my dreams and can control them.",
          "More and more images appear, similar to dream images, but I can look at and slightly steer them in the waking state.",
          "Otherwise awake, very awake, even.",
          "I feel neither tired nor wide awake, but relaxedly awake.",
          "About a little over a year ago, I started using Sam Harris' Waking Up app.",
          "The dream became lucid and clear, and I noticed that dream sequences seemed to repeat themselves, this helped me to wake up in the dream: it became crystal clear to me that I was sleeping and dreaming.",
          "In contrast to normal waking consciousness, a kind of depth dimension is added.",
          "Lucid dreaming and waking sleep are less common.",
          "No digression, no dreaming... A rather strong presence in wakefulness.",
          "But a dream unconsciously and insidiously leads me away.",

          "This is non-dual unity which is where qualities of bliss, unity begin so I call this pure consciousness because it is not pure awareness only, however pure awareness remains the foundation within forms of consciousness appearing.",

          "The 'pure awareness', as you call it, is pure lightness and the experience of light in its pure nature.",

          "The state of pure awareness is a state in which one virtually removes one's own consciousness from the body, as if \"standing beside oneself.\"",
          "For me, experiencing pure awareness is an experience that occurs both in meditation and in everyday life, has much to do with the direction of my focus and is like a shining through of reality when all ideas, concepts... step aside for a moment.",

          "And as long as one cannot concretely express this HOW, one has not been in PURE awareness.",

          "My experience of pure awareness is full of contradictions—empty and full, light and dark, both smooth and rough.",
          "But this very attempt fails at this specific point of pure awareness.",

          "With each further onset of consciousness, awareness fades away.",

          "Pure awareness is a state that feels completely harmonious and beautiful and is connected to all life on Earth and in the entire universe.",
          "The senses of hearing and feeling are often very active in me; I perceive things in my closer surroundings as if I were standing next to them.",
          "Cultivating a relationship with pure awareness is wonderful; it's the only thing I truly control—where I direct my attention, though even that is debatable.",
          "Pure awareness is the realization of finally having found home after an eternal search.",
          "So from awareness of awareness then 2) awareness becomes aware of itself without my help.",
          "Only short, but clearly perceptible.",
          "Awareness without end - clear and vast and at the same time everything within it, from it.",
          "What you have defined as 'pure awareness', I would describe as follows: being aware that some (any) content of experience appears (even very subtle, like the fact of breathing or just being alive), and then becoming aware that what appears is the non-appearing of something that does not appear.",
          "Describing 'pure awareness' often relies on single words or short phrases—'qualia-catchers.'",
          "Pure awareness occurs in brief moments (I can't determine the duration), where I cease all mental activity and have no visual, auditory, tactile, or olfactory perceptions.",
          "It becomes obvious and without doubt \"feel-\" and recognizable that awareness is constantly and exclusively aware of itself and that a previous feeling conditioned by acquired beliefs (I as a person WITH awareness am constantly aware of a new object in a sequence) is factually wrong.",
          "They are not them without me to perceive.",
          "Awareness is simply aware *as* them, not *of* them.",

          "Everything was awareness.",
          "At an earlier moment, more in the context of shamatha, 'awareness of awareness' practice has sensitised, opened up... With this practice: very much on the forefront the clarity and the knowingness of this indestructible awareness, with my 'getting out of the way'.",
          "That cannot be known by the mind.",
          "Awareness was everywhere/in no particular place and mapped straight on to experience itself.",
          "Sometimes I have a clear experience of awareness in everyday life.",
          "I experience awareness as an experience of emptiness in the sense of undefined harmony with simultaneous cognitive ability.",
          "What still perceives, even though perception has disappeared?",
          "On the other hand, there are paradoxical states of consciousness: a vast emptiness and yet a vibrant fullness, a presence of Being that opens up deepest serenity and simultaneously overwhelming ecstasy and bliss.",
          "When a thought arises from pure awareness, it is allowed (not forced) to dissolve back into pure awareness.",
          "For me, pure awareness is a calm, impersonal, blissful presence.",
          "The main and almost exclusive contents of consciousness were light and awareness.",
          "For me, pure awareness is flow.",
          "It's difficult to describe awareness without content or object; it's like sight without vision, a simple acknowledgment of what is, pure awakeness, the fundamental feeling of consciousness being 'on,' the constant underlying all experience.",
          "• Awareness of awareness in vastness, stillness, peace • Awareness with later-arriving visions",
          "In the true state of true pure awareness, objective observation is first possible.",
          "Everything is THAT—pure awareness, pure consciousness, God, presence.",
          "Later note: I couldn't re-enter Big Awareness.",
          "For me, the state of pure awareness is an envelopment.",
          "Knowing my awareness is everything, and 'I' am a small part.",
          "Only perception, connected with the moment without evaluation.",
          "In pure awareness I experience awareness itself, inseparable from all emerging or disappearing experiences in mind or body.",
          "If I focus particularly on awareness itself, it begins to pervade all experience.",
          "Awareness as a field or space in which reality appears.",
          "From this it is relatively easy for me to switch to pure awareness or I also describe it as \"hearing with bat ears\".",
          "It is what I experience as expanding pure awareness, and it encompasses God, myself, and all creatures.",
          "For example, I had many thoughts, but pure awareness was thought-free.",
          "Awareness settles and expands to infinity.",
          "No sensory perceptions, pure inner seeing.",
          "And in my opinion, it is only then possible to distinguish between subjective and objective perception.",
          "Pure awareness is spontaneous, without content, if content is 'something', and yet 'content' is there, if content does not mean 'nothing'; pure awareness exists from itself, seems and has no observer, since there is no place of retreat, everything is there, clear, absence of aggression.",
          "Pure awareness seems to occur when I am able to distance/separate whatever I am from the feeling of being behind my eyes or in my body.",
          "This particular issue is always so pertinent in my mind that is acts on these rare occasions in which I experience what I am describing as a kind of barometer, at the point where I no longer have quibbles about the impossibility of pure experience, because I know that pure experience is not simple or clean.",
          "It is also possible that sensory perceptions are included in the horizon of attention.",
          "Pure awareness, yes, but fuller than that – a brightness unrelated to color/light is another good expression!",
          "In this state, one can recognize functions, not only that everything that even remotely exists is \"somehow\" connected, but rather, in true pure awareness, one recognizes HOW something is connected to something else.",
          "It gives me the liberating and ridiculous or humorous realization: If I did not exist as an organism, I would not be aware of awareness - and that too is completely irrelevant and unimportant in this moment.",
          "I am only aware of existing.",
          "The attempt to formulate the content of awareness disenchants it again.",
          "In a certain way, I can recognize the consciousness behind a perception at any time, if I want to, unless I am very absorbed or involved in actions and emotions.......",
          "First, the question of where the limit of pure awareness is should be clarified.",
          "Not at the center of the experience of hearing or thinking, but aware of those things (and maybe all things?)",
          "Being fully, purely aware, without intellectually recognizing a new mind state.",
          "What perceives that there is no more perception?",
          "When the meaning of 'appearing' (being aware) becomes 'the non-appearing of the non-appearing', then any content of experience (sensible or not) fades, goes to the background.",
          "My experience with pure awareness often appears in groups.",
          "In any case, it was the closest I've experienced to 'pure awareness.'",
          "Or is absolute awareness meant?",
          "– This may now sound like philosophy, but it is only an attempt to put this state of pure awareness into words for myself.",
          "Pure awareness that there is no awareness.",
          "As already mentioned, suitable words are lacking for subtle experiential worlds, because these have fixed meaning patterns, and in 'pure awareness' nothing is clearly defined anymore and it does not follow any standardized pattern...",
          "Pure awareness happens as something physical, holistic.",
          "Describing the Big Awareness Event is pointless; it's always there, bigger than words.",
          "Pure awareness is: dissolution in space and time, highest alertness in absolute inner stillness and immobility, boundless perception of other human beings, dying and rebirth in one moment.",
          "Pure awareness, you call it in this survey.",
          "It is here that there are two roads where I can remain a witness as a big sky awareness viewing the coming and going of things like birds and clouds or I realize/feel/know that all appearances are made of awareness.",
          "Who in me experiences perception?",
          "What remains is the fact of experiencing (being aware of) something that is not there.",
          "Pure awareness for me is weightless, dreamless and totally aware of the moment.",
          "I remain completely concentrated on this perception, believe I clearly recognize how the field of awareness is aware of its own weakness.",
          "In the state of pure awareness, thoughts come to rest, but at the same time there is a clarity of thought in the sense of harmonization with existing situations or people.",
          "I write 'I am of the opinion' and not 'I can maintain pure awareness', because we always stay in the conceptual and talk about something that is rather beyond the conceptual.",
          "I experience pure awareness as a thoughtless moment of connectedness with myself, which often creates in me a feeling of well-being and inner kindness.",
          "In pure awareness, I always experience a lightness.",
          "I am very aware in the wide, unlimited field of being.",
          "No information nodes today, no exciting stories – only Being.",

          "There is not even perception anymore.",
          "The 'hearing', the perception through the ears is very pronounced, very strong.",
          "Or I perceive sensory perceptions, from cars or nature, but I only pay short attention to them, not long.",
          "May this assist in your assertion of my and others imperceptible experiences.",
          "Unfortunately, fewer and fewer people allow themselves such an attitude, or they are generally hardly capable of it due to manifold distractions, because that is exactly what is needed for entering into 'pure awareness': a STOP!",
          "I only perceive what is.",
          "I have a little trouble with the terminology of the survey, \"awareness of awareness\", etc., i.e., bringing the terminology into line with my experience - I can give more poetic descriptions.",
          "There is only awareness that I am.",
          "From my point of view, there are several ways to experience \"pure awareness.\"",

          "It is the source of happiness and energy for me, which enriches my life outside of \"pure awareness.\"",
          "On the other hand, I am fully aware of the place where I am and, if applicable, of the fellow meditators.",
          "The only way I can assert an experience of pure awareness is by looking back on the session, at which point an observer is fabricated.",

          "As I said, I was only in this space.",
          "The transition to the above-described state of \"pure mind\" can be fluid for me.",

          "A few times also consciously to cross the border to 100%, with the perception of the real transition from duality into unity and later the return.",
          "- With the distance of now almost 22 years and the experience gained in this time, I have come to the conclusion that consciousness had undergone a change in perspective, out of the focus on the ego-consciousness to the awareness of the field to which this ego-consciousness is connected.",

          "I was walking outside and realised that I was in a very different mental, physical and emotional state.",

          "I was wide awake and I am sure I could have ended the state, but there was no reason to do so.",
          "On the one hand, it felt as if I were shielded from the environment through my senses ('cheese bell', e.g., hearing, bodily sensations, etc.",
          "At the same time, I feel the feelings when it comes to people who communicate or sense them without identifying with them or suffering from them.",
          "It was a very profound experience for me.",
          "I look straight ahead with my eyes open or slightly upwards, preferably into a wide space.",
          "I experience a strong feeling of motion, that feels like feeling backwards.",
          "Whenever this experience came, it always gave me the feeling that it would never go away.",
          "I had my eyes open and noticed everything that was happening, but my emotions did not seem to be connected/involved.",
          "I was all in one place, not scattered at all, like in usual day to day life.",

          "there was no clear separation between me and the space around me.",
          "Certainly the experience is characterised by a different composition of structures in my consciousness, although a pertinent aspect of the experience is a sense of 'inevitable' or 'procedural' continuity from normal states, as if it is the natural result of reasoning processes playing out and being unfettered in their bleeding down into my full embodied consciousness.",

          "I don't really know any more which it is, but I do know that it helps me—it is a nuance that I had rather glossed over, and in fact, it is quite a new thing for me to regularly practice the last four exercises of the sixteen, having been focused on the first eight for the last twenty years or so.",

          "An arrival, no more becoming, timeless.",
          "While meditating - very simple breath observation - resting meditation - the breath deepens and it feels as if it happens on its own and my whole body would immerse itself in the breathing movement, body boundaries dissolve warm-pulsatingly ... at some point only the perception of \"breath happens in space\", no I who perceives, but an impression of \"there are impersonal eyes in the space\".",

          "Am I crazy?",
          "Immediately, everyday thoughts stop flowing; there is a sensation like... turning on the light, there is a non-visual brightness that my mind can interpret in a visual way, but there is the certainty that its nature is not visual.",
          "Initially, intense pulsing energy/electricity in my body, some painful cramping, but never felt threatening.",
          "In that moment, I was one with everything around me.",

          "Activities around me, noises, changes in lighting conditions materialize as waves in the head and torso area.",
          "It became clear to me, and it was as if a play was played to me to illustrate this, that my life on earth was just a temporary creation, or a game, that all my encounters with other people, with everything, were arranged for me, as situations, but that myself, and all these encountered, were now lifted away, and it was revealed, that there were but creatures, who had been put there to play a role, as characters in a play, who collapse back into the actors they really are, when the show is over, and go back behind the scene to rest, like puppets.",
          "It's like a mole tunnel, deeper into the earth.",
          "Having thus restored the contemplation of this 'new void', I emerged from the meditation with a sense of infinite lightness, but also sadness for not having been able to see beyond, deeper, a definitive truth that was palpable in the field of experience, but unattainable.",
          "Perhaps the lifting of opposites was also very important in it, or their compatibility, an ability to be simultaneous.",
          "There was like a round sensation that felt like wholeness, oneness, as if that roundness was the whole world (although it wasn't physical, and there was no narration to it, it was a sensation of form and unity without form).",
          "I never knew there was anything beyond the thinking (monkey) mind.",
          "My old friend's face appeared in my mind, viewing him as an authority figure; I felt inferior, realizing more needed to be done.",

          "Including going to work, time with social contacts and other everyday activities.",
          "Again there is no difference between the energies (or the feel of them) of thought and clear light – there is the basic difference in spaciousness, but when moving from still clear light to the thought clear light there is also a spaciousness about it, as it is the focus of the awareness at the time - there is nothing else at that point but the clear light of the thought – the only clear light at that instant.\"",
          "I'm in white light, without thoughts or sensations of body or environment.",
          "Thought and the sense of 'me' were gone; only awake, clear knowing.",

          "The second experience was in the spring of 2019.",
          "It usually takes a relatively long time and a conscious letting go.",
          "When the knower is knowing the known there is separation When the known includes and transcends the knower there is love Why did I cry?",
          "In this respect, it was a state of complete solitude - but without any admixture of loneliness whatsoever.",
          "It is a bit comparable to lighting a light in an absolutely empty, dark room.",
          "I see that synchronicity, in particular, shows the truth or reflects what one experiences.",
          "I may be mixing sensations from different experiences of pure awareness in this report, as it is difficult for me to specifically recall one experience.",
          "At this point, it becomes difficult to describe, not so much in a literary sense, but more that it describes many things that we have poor mental models for.",
          "Then my focus is inward, although observing everything that goes through the senses.",
          "This state was timeless and spaceless.",
          "Almost as if my body has assumed its own functioning while my mind has become focused on simply being.",
          "Best regards T. E.",
          "Nothing as in being no sort of object or phenomenon whatsoever.",
          "It is not dual but has a taste of non-duality.",
          "I could experience internal dialogue, but very little arose naturally; it was a willful effort to talk to myself.",
          "No sense of personal life story or personal past history.",
          "I was like unconscious and I had no thoughts and didn't follow any noise I heard.",
          "It was a borderless and bright source of light, emanating forms and colors, sounds and smells and touch, within and transcending infinite space and time, like an exploding star in the cold space of the universe.",
          "My hands lost their shape, and my body became points of vibration, tingling, or temperature.",
          "Over time and with regular practice, this experience has become more and more stable and refined.",
          "Suddenly, about 25 meters away from me, a light behind a frosted glass pane comes on...",
          "At that very moment, something inside me let go.",
          "I am not writing here about what many perceive in altered states of consciousness, but about what goes beyond (or rather into) that.",
          "Emotions came and went without identification; they were content, not part of the 'I'.",
          "A feeling of being limitless and observing is there, surrounded by and part of limitless space.",
          "When it was my turn, I didn't know what to say; what I had found was something so different from other experiences that it seemingly didn't fit here.",
          "Something that moves me to tears.",
          "I was just there, everything was alright, this was the Truth.",

          "still appear as chair and table, but no longer so real, as if they were only dream objects.",
          "No visual images per se before closed eyes, but I saw again and again movements of energy/light shortly before and in between.",
          "Or is there just feeling?",
          "I am the space in which everything appears.",
          "And there was a kind of desire to do that.",
          "I was fully aware of the experience the whole time.",
          "If I experience the inner dynamics of pure being, then there are also light experiences.",
          "I am in Zen Sesshin, and towards the end of one of the 25-minute sitting periods, it's as if I'm no longer there.",
          "Relaxation and letting go is generally difficult for me, therefore a very analytical component often quickly comes into play in such states - but the time until the intellect switches on and then again the time in which the intellect is perceived as something that 'happens' feels like a relatively pure consciousness.",
          "This was only the preface, however important that question had been for me.",
          "It is almost a matter of attention, if one so likes one can make one more dominant than the other, though both are there.",
          "I am completely there and awake.",
          "In it no I, which only formed like air bubbles in water towards the fading of the experience.",
          "Just to think about it was not possible.",
          "She speaks to me in her language all the time, and I can hear her to the degree my wakefulness allows.",
          "The awareness that this is my true nature—infinite, eternal, indestructible—was profound.",
          "The subsequent bodily excretion was completely changed, then normal again.",
          "While I was used to the fact that feelings of happiness could be brought about by special kicks, and easily disappear again with the kick, I now experience this new kind of happiness: A happiness even without a kick.",
          "Breakthrough experience at the age of 21: Through the process of self-inquiry with my then Indian teacher catapulted into formless, endless being.",
          "I have had several experiences, but the last one was by far the most intense.",
          "However, it's incredibly liberating, and I believe further research could greatly benefit many people.",
          "In another experience during a retreat, absorbed in meditation, I asked myself, 'If being takes care of itself, why is there so much suffering?'",
          "The spaciousness was not confined to internal visual space but instead also included internal auditory space as well as somatic space.",
          "I am there.",
          "My consciousness distanced me from myself, a movement motivated by my own existence.",
          "Initially, I deliberately avoided stray thoughts, forcing myself to be present.",
          "As I said, I have always perceived many vibrations/emotions...",
          "At first, the thoughts kept coming as usual, and gradually my thought flow got less intense, and the periods of thoughtlessness became longer.",
          "The deepest absorption was a singular experience.",
          "Everything was bright and light and effortless.",
          "I had this quality of experience more often later.",
          "If not, it is a state of \"awareness\" for me, which practically flows without thoughts... Then I experience states of recognition or pure being or oneness or...",
          "Occasionally occurred during meditation, in complete wakefulness, an experience of boundlessness, yet physical, floating, yet dense, bright, open, without thoughts.",
          "Another time, right after opening eyes after a 20 min session, I felt I was located at the flower vase on the table in front of me, and then \"came back to my body\" after a few brief moments.",
          "Desire vanished; I was one with everything.",
          "Since then, I've had several similar experiences randomly throughout my day where I suddenly was aware again, and very often I just have to laugh or smile when it happens.",
          "But this expectation is not fulfilled.",
          "Or rather, something within me has gotten used to them.",
          "Although it involved an auditory experience, there was no judgment of the experience as \"auditory\" in nature.",
          "Very quiet sensations in certain parts of the body, as if something were changing there.",
          "I feel a connection to a larger whole, a higher consciousness, the source, and I absorb this power and energy from above into my being—like an encounter in another world—timeless awareness in peace, love, and inner happiness... the world around fades into the background, a being, pure being beyond it... almost thoughtless, timeless—I am I—in harmony with myself and all that is... deep peace.",
          "This space has a warm, inviting, and comfortable infinity.",

          "Holding my daughter was the crowning moment, endless wonder.",
          "I kind of felt like I was the awareness, but at the same time I was kind of observing it, but I am not sure whether the part that was observing was also being observed in its entirety.",
          "Towards the end, I had a feeling of the awareness slipping away, I could see thoughts appearing, especially ones related to sensory experiences and grasping (didn't want to leave the state).",
          "There were no bright lights or fireworks per se, I was left more with a state of ease.",
          "During the day: lots of energy for action.",
          "In that Peace, every effort other than what was necessary for functional purposes was painful.",
          "Light can appear, in my case flickering, i.e.",
          "Body sensations, thoughts, feelings, senses—all are manifestations or light plays on the three-dimensional canvas.",

          "I knew that this was the end of my sadhana (spiritual practice).",
          "Rather than feeling myself as THAT TO WHICH these experiences were given, I felt myself identical with the ACTIVITY of experiencing itself.",
          "2) Experience - One instance, when meditating I kept exploring feelings/thoughts, questioning 'who had the thought', it suddenly sunk in, at a deep visceral level there is no guy I all these years identified as me.",
          "My thoughts became unstructured.",
          "This is a normative... condition which is able to notice itself at any time.",
          "Although I think the duration of the experience was brief (maybe a minute or so), the experience was stable enough for me to recall it when I returned to a more reflective state.",
          "I have rather strong general anxiety and have found the experience both calming and stressful.",
          "But then, at some point, material reality catches up with me again.",
          "This opens the space for pure awareness—ego-centric qualities recede and become unimportant.",
          "This 'pointing out' technique is part of Dzogchen and Tibetan Buddhism.",
          "I would express it differently, but the suddenly emerging hypnosis text, the suddenly spoken word/content, is a creation from another essence.",
          "This is how I experience it in this state.",
          "It's so vast..., weightless...",
          "And yet it was not solid, fixed, or tangible, and yet also very clear and free!",
          "My eyes were looking nowhere and everywhere; the core feeling was stillness.",
          "Everything I was and knew or thought I knew was unimportant.",
          "I simply loved everything.",
          "My eyes always fill with tears, not because I was crying, but it felt as if the eyes were being cleansed by the tear fluid when opening them after the meditation and giving me a radiance.",
          "As if I had gotten a first impression of what 'God' really is.",
          "Three qualities of pure consciousness are fundamental: (1) the quality of stillness, which makes pure consciousness the absolute point of reference for all recognition; (2) the quality of limitlessness, which opens access to all possibilities of recognition; and (3) the quality of dynamism, which constantly connects the limited and the unlimited.",
          "On retreats, after hours of practice, our group became a cloud, figures, inside and outside of me.",
          "Deep relaxation, stress reduction.",
          "It seemed like no alternative conclusion could be reached, other than that feeling.",
          "The state was exhilarating!",
          "The experience was of existential significance for me.",
          "During the meditation, it became clear to me, not only cognitively but also emotionally, that this self was not to be found, but merely a consciousness that can be observed, perceived, by another kind of consciousness.",
          "I fell through reality for hours.",
          "There were no more boundaries or different objects.",
          "Something I can say about the quality of experiences which seem to meet, to at least a good extent, what you describe as 'pure awareness' was a knowing felt in the body, not just a standard insight.",
          "You have a daughter at home.\"",
          "Ultimately, the state is nothing special; it is essentially a dwelling in the state of pre-cognitive perception, in which the mind does not yet elaborate concrete contents, unless I allow this to happen intentionally.",
          "With relaxation, those contractions abated and the spaciousness/expansiveness returned.",
          "Active, connected, timeless, effortless, self-evident.",
          "These states are an inspiration for other meditations on love and compassion and also for acting in daily life.",
          "I was the neutral receptive person, embedded in the whole of this living world.",
          "A feeling of absolute thoughtlessness.",
          "On the sixth day terrible films come: During the morning walk in the garden, a relatively harmless external trigger hits me: Two rats in a live trap.",
          "It was completely effortless.",
          "I can't describe it, it was as if it were outside of me.",
          "Through repeated experiences of this being, it became a peaceful flow that spread more and more into daily activities, so that I can be dynamically active at the same time and yet remain at rest within myself.",
          "I did this regularly, sitting in the meditation posture with my eyes closed.",
          "The experience occurred drug-induced.",
          "My experience had a character of luminosity and love, but not human love: it is as if I had first gone through a particularly clear state of awareness, of centering, and then another field had \"opened\", normally invisible, of perceptual objects linked to divine love (I had performed shamanic practices in the days before, but none had anything to do with the objects I saw during that experience, nor had I known them before, nor can I remember the numinous images I saw well, even though I saw them clearly).",
          "After minutes of a storm of thoughts, absolute quiet sets in: no thought waves, no physical sensations, the breathing is calm and slow.",
          "I feel very liberated, light, carefree and smiling.",
          "Would it be an appropriate description to say that there was an emptiness in your experience, \"an emptiness that has awakened to itself\"?",
          "There was no personality associated with the noticing, no discernible quality; just the awareness of awareness, as such.",
          "The event itself seemed to just happen.",
          "It also feels really, really good; there's a texture of pleasure to it.",
          "It is in this state where my experiences have occurred whereby I am a simple unified awareness, seemingly without the daytime qualities of ego.",
          "I can observe my thoughts as something separate from me, I see them pictorially in a white room.",
          "In deep meditations I repeatedly \"experience\" this absolute emptiness, which is connected with brightness and spaciousness.",
          "I can re-enter this experience at will but without the intensity of this moment.",
          "The perception of the senses and of thinking somehow receded into the background.",
          "I was no longer just the person I am now.",
          "Suddenly all the pain was gone, there were no thoughts, no physical sensations, only alert attention, joy and the sight of light on the wall in front of me.",
          "Suddenly I plunged into a state of non-duality.",
          "Perhaps as if the ever-present noticing itself has come to a standstill :-)",
          "For a few moments I vanished but was instead a void perceiving reality as a bright picture.",
          "It was as if all normal disturbances, discursive thoughts, feelings, everything evaporated, yet was still there.",
          "I was sitting with eyes open and paying attention to my breath.",
          "The sea didn't belong to me.",
          "It's a complete unity of body and mind; I'm exploring its extent and practical uses (health, development, understanding nature).",
          "Then, as instructed, I 'looked for the one who was looking.'",
          "The experience began with a pleasant tingling in the lower abdomen and rose up to the head and was then briefly experienced by me as a bright light.",
          "Only love remains...",
          "From that moment on there is no more memory.",
          "It's as if you achieve a kind of autonomy over your own thoughts, but because of that, you can see clearly, not just what you predispose yourself to see with your interests, complexes, expectations, etc.",
          "It was powerful and profound and I think about it often.",
          "The experience of boundlessness and bliss now also occurs together with logical thinking, feelings, and spiritual perceptions.",
          "Everything flowed as if by itself, everything ran intuitively and was perfectly correct.",
          "I described this experience to my teacher via email.",
          "Suddenly, a young cow stormed through the garden from next door—I only thought, oh, that could be dangerous for the child, but quite calmly, without this contemplative feeling changing.",
          "Simply sitting, with closed eyes.",
          "This happens completely unspectacularly.",
          "In the \"actual\" (mantra) meditation there are certain transitions when thoughts disappear at exactly that moment.",
          "Pure as such is declinable and thus capable of being intensified.",
          "I perceive this experience as a very natural state, while I perceive the other states of consciousness as unnatural as long as the experience of this pure being lasts.",
          "I can only describe it metaphorically: it feels like standing on the shore and watching the tide draw the ocean back.",
          "The experience I used to answer this questionnaire was one I had on a psilocybin journey as part of Johns Hopkins research on long-term meditators.",
          "A three-year-old child was playing next to me, but I was not occupied with anything and did not think about anything.",
          "A space without thought, very fluid.",
          "That's when the intense experience ended.",
          "Even then, they are always only moments, timeless moments.",
          "When I lost this boundary, I lost responsibility for my body, and a feeling of peace emerged—as if it were always there.",
          "The straightening up and walking afterwards feels very supple.",
          "I sit and am.",
          "In one peak state, it was an experience as if I could taste the awareness; it was sweet (non-sensual taste).",
          "Absolute bodilessness and timelessness, begins with pleasant heaviness and then lets go of more and more body and mind",
          "After a few attempts, that worked briefly once.",
          "There are also other, shorter states in me, for example when falling asleep, when I let go of thoughts or direct my attention to consciousness itself.",
          "I worked in the kitchen and suddenly I smelled the fragrance of the tea that I was preparing.",
          "From the experience I referenced in this questionnaire: While meditating, seated, trying to understand 'who am I?",
          "The absolute silence in my mind was enormous and it was spacious, very spacious, perhaps endless.",
          "Although I meant it that way, physical suicide was not an option.",
          "I experience strong fluctuations of synchronicity from time to time, that is, when I experience something, e.g., hear or see something, my actions or words reflect it.",
          "Everything is alright, as it is.",
          "My body seems to dissolve into my surroundings.",
          "Retrospectively, I would describe it as a void (of thoughts?",
          "I could then remain in that state 'forever'.",
          "The space around me is white and bright.",
          "Without reference, since it is everywhere and nowhere.",
          "Was calm knowing but when I realized I couldn't wake up out of this state I started to worry a bit.",
          "I find myself jumping back towards nothing, and the experience of awareness showing itself in its entirety, without a possible 'me' between the knowing and the being of the experience.",
          "Perhaps it is also interesting that shortly before the peak experience I believed that I was opening a forbidden, red door, like a kind of warning.",
          "I felt boundless vastness, emptiness, stillness within and around me.",
          "This experience has changed everything in my life, and I am now trying to find the most effective and beneficial way of helping others with this knowledge.",
          "From clear thinking, I can suddenly know for sure what to do.",
          "The experience I considered for this questionnaire occurred in 2015 after about a year of meditation and experimenting with dzogchen's attention inversion.",
          "Then I went to the course, and afterward I wrote the third and last possible exam without extraordinarily intensive preparation and got a one.",
          "I was shaped by the feeling of fulfillment, wisdom, and knowledge, without being able to specify it.",
          "Everything felt irrelevant.",
          "Thoughts arise, pass, arise; I am emotionally neutral, relaxed.",
          "'Unity' best describes it, though this implies something beyond awareness, which wasn't the case—awareness was all there was.",
          "During the 'turning,' an amused thought arose: 'What idiot hid joy in the midst of heartbreak?'",
          "This does not fit with my concepts of non-dual unity consciousness.",
          "It was one of the most powerful and life-altering experiences.",
          "Furthermore, I felt a hard-to-describe feeling that thoughts were lurking in the back of my mind, of which I was fully aware, but I recognized their transience and insignificance.",
          "I feel deep calm, contentment.",
          "Everything arose within awareness and since then I can drop easily into a similar experience.",
          "Fully dwell in the present moment and very alert of your own being…",
          "When I \"shut down\" my emotions, then this is a very unpleasant state - it is more favorable for me to perceive my emotions.",
          "After a three-week course, I experienced a conscious separation from my surroundings for over a week during my visits to the city center.",
          "Like traveling through time, but realizing it in a tangible way, each moment is the only thing that is real, and we are in an inescapable tunnel of 'now', and I was in the tunnel, but again, 'me' was everything that could possibly be, in that tunnel of the moment.",
          "What I describe is stages along the way to arriving at a deep concentration which I find myself unable to describe.",
          "Conscious, without consciousness, I lay in the grass.",
          "And all these answers to the questionnaire are only from what I describe as the fragrance that was left when I returned somehow from the state.",
          "After months, I 'saw' the reality: no special state or sensation was needed.",
          "Weightlessness is also an impression I remember, but I had felt this weightlessness as mirroring myself in water consciousness in an empty infinite space of fullness.",
          "This is, of course, only possible to a limited extent.",
          "The usual pain in my knees that I experience when sitting in a cross-legged position was gone, I could sit up straight relatively easily and I was wondering where my body ends.",
          "One experience was a feeling of a dreamlike state that lasted for several days, where everything was harmonious, in order, easily perceivable, but I felt little to no urge to react to what I was experiencing.",
          "Everything is the same.",
          "It's hard to put into words or conceptualize this 'revelation,' both in this specific case and in daily meditation.",
          "I hope I can do this again!'",
          "It also improved my connections with patients and colleagues; I see our shared humanity more clearly, recognizing that there's no 'them' and 'me', only 'us'.",
          "It feels like a weightless blanket is on my shoulders and around me, enveloping me but not delimiting me.",
          "I was able to spend several hours of my usual daily life like that.",
          "All these sensations occur simultaneously, and I can shift my attention to any of them.",
          "It was effortless.",
          "There was no longer any spatial, temporal, or felt difference.",
          "Lifting the dualistic viewpoint.",
          "With that, the fascination for pure consciousness slowly came to an end.",
          "It has a quality of infinity to it like a torus rotating around its central circle.",
          "Everything was most beautiful.",
          "There was a body, but it was not perceived any differently than anything else.",
          "Each of these gaining increased clarity the more I focus on the somatic feeling and point of awareness I use to produce them.",
          "My experience was with my eyes closed, I was meditating in the phase of high equanimity (as per Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha by Daniel Ingram) and at some point my internal sense field no longer included clues to my body, it was all just empty space with very faint but uniform tingling occurring in this space.",
          "It was such a simple thing, I thought, how could it just go?",
          "Everything appeared different but was in actuality the very same.",
          "I felt on the edge of something.",
          "The experience was indiscernible from looking in a mirror while awake.",
          "I've had many intense experiences, varying in nature.",
          "I am this creation field, still energy containing all creation as a delicate structure, potential.",
          "Tears welled up in my eyes.",
          "I was very happy after the experience as I had a sense of having had a direct experience of an underlying or overarching reality (more real than real/normal reality), and was reassured that these states really do exist, which I sometimes doubt, and that meditation can take you to places like this.",
          "In that case I felt an overwhelming despair, a despair without pain.",
          "Before a presentation to 200 entrepreneurs, I felt paralyzing fear.",
          "It is as special as it is ordinary.",
          "No fears, no worries, no doubts.",
          "If I had chosen a different event, my answers would be completely different.",
          "I thought, how foolish it was to think that this world had ever disturbed me!",

          "I also became aware that I did not want to meet anybody, because this would almost inevitably have interrupted the precious silence, the wonderful clarity.",
          "This was just something I often found myself doing, and subsequently continued to do as I discovered I could relax my nerves effectively, particularly before big games.",
          "There were periods of 'dark night of the soul'—mental, emotional, and physical clarifications seemingly ongoing, aiming to encompass all appearances as the SELF.",
          "I am absolutely focused on the silence and can bear it.",

          "Time seems to dissolve, as does space, at the very moment when this knowledge simply enters the relaxed consciousness, I am fully aware of these qualities.",
          "Then I experienced being progressively very unified (body and mind jointly united) and of great bliss without discursive thoughts or interference of images, I was totally present; at the same time an indescribable lightness, an inner silence and a widening of consciousness but also of the body which was nevertheless dense at the same time; I felt like sitting deep within myself; time no longer existed but I was very aware of the variations in my environment, my consciousness and my body were more \"lucid\" and I saw things as if through transparency, that is to say that I felt what was behind the phenomena, the words, the things perceived by my senses; with an intuitive acuity and a deep peace because nothing bothered me; I was both in a bodily sensation of subtlety/lightness and at the same time with the weight and solidity of a mountain.",

          "Walking around, everything looked different, yet the same.",
          "It happened effortlessly.",
          "I can also get to this state by using some \"headless\" techniques like pretending that I have no head or that, in motion, my body is actually static and the world is moving.",
          "Everything was as it is.",
          "Sometimes these experiences were short; I couldn't tell how long they were, but I calculated that they always started somewhere around the 30-minute mark of meditation.",
          "The state is by no means euphoric, but it can lead to euphoria after meditation.",
          ".......... Somewhere in the 9th Karmapa's book there is reference to the danger of being exposed to insight too early so that one only reaches a dry intellectual understanding; one becomes \"jaded\".",
          "It requires letting go, allowing the pull, and guided attention subtly accompanying and directing the pull.",

          "Anything I sensed was within my awareness sphere, and I identified with that big awareness (though that's not quite right).",
          "Then we relax by letting concentration dissolve into awareness within time.",
          "I had my eyes closed and there was some kind of empty blackness all around, but it was just one part of things that happened in this 'pure' state.",
          "Though the world continues (sounds, people talking), I'm not aware of being present in it; there's just a stillness pervading everything.",
          "I always have the feeling, from a certain depth, during Zazen, that everything is divided into spaces or fields, everything without any limitation.",
          "I could think quite normally and control my actions.",
          "It was as if I were watching the clouds in the sky.",

          "The leader asked if I wanted to continue; I said yes, moving from standing to lying.",
          "There was a sense of totality, of my not being there at all, of there being no 'me', no separate entity, for that border had been dissolved.",
          "Even if, through the feeling of this intensely experienced joy, a part of the mind seems almost overwhelmed, it has nevertheless arrived in such a way that no thought activity distracts, but the powerful presence as self-empowerment, like a coronation, like a radiation that purifies everything that distracts, especially any forms of pain or limitations.",
          "I'm trying to stabilize this experience.",
          "Enjoy luminous consciousness.",
          "Can that be?",
          "I cannot provoke it or achieve it with a specific thought, intention, activity, or the like.",
          "I regard this experience as a feeling of unity and I feel truly connected to our universe during these states.",
          "I was pure me and everything at once, I was no more and knew that I am deeply who I am.",
          "It happened that at one point during formal practice, I entered or became an infinite, timeless space, and I was no longer identified with my thoughts and emotions.",
          "Present for every moment, just be, just hear, just taste, do not judge, do not add anything to a single thought, just feel what you are feeling, remember to ask what is it, no past, no future, just now, fully human, everything, anything, take it in, deeper than the surface, go where all humans want go but don't go.",
          "It was an experience of restful alertness and boundlessness, without thoughts and without mantra.",
          "The intense experience described above has not occurred again in this way.",
          "But that was probably just the reflection on the water....",
          "I then experience this as presence, alertness and openness.",
          "My knee pain vanished, as did my sense of time.",
          "When I took this view from the subtle perspective of an observer, then the space/consciousness was filled with a kind of vibration and a kind of inner luminescence (which has nothing to do with real brightness).",
          "From inside the experience, there was nothing that existed to provide any effort, so of course it did not need any.",
          "Then I had a feeling of greater awareness in which I became more aware of both the thoughts passing through my mind and of the experience of being the observer of the thoughts rather than the thinker of the thoughts.",
          "This went hand in hand with my kind of \"embedding\" of all experiences in a larger space that is inaccessible to us because it is unconscious (otherwise it would be an experience).",
          "In a pulsating, fractal-like sequence.",
          "But it is remarkable that the experiences are not at all random: Once the conditions of being well rested and settled in mind and body are met, the experiences are there.",
          "I am the thread, I am the infinite and I am the body, all at the same time, but easy, no complications, no confusions, that is just the way it is.",
          "My first clear experience of oneness was at age 11, observing nature and feeling resolved by it.",
          "There was no future or past, no fear or worry.",
          "It is so still that it is already loud.",
          "No longer just the head, consciousness, but the whole conscious body-being.",
          "Many of these experiences, however, strongly oscillate between the merging of awareness and observer and the repeated finding that this was just a \"moment without ingredients\".",

          "In this phase, the space expanded and time no longer played a role; there was only pure being, a pure feeling of happiness, which was simultaneously a feeling of infinity and the feeling of being connected with everything.",
          "Although I hesitate to speak of a feeling here.",
          "It was as if one could see through all experience, one sees the projections of the mind and feels the projection surface behind it, which simply \"is.\"",
          "In TM there are the so-called Sidhi techniques, where one sets thought impulses at the level of pure awareness (or close to it).",

          "I strongly identified with the question \"Would it be an appropriate description to say that your pure awareness – in recognizing itself – also recognized itself as the awareness that had always been present in all past experiences?\"",

          "It was more as if the stream of LIFE as a whole were present in that one moment, in that specific place and everywhere at once.",
          "In a sense, it's as if I were locked in a closet all day and can finally get out; if that happened, the sensation would surely be similar to this state of meditation.",

          "It came with a rounding, bright, physical presence.",
          "The distinction between self and world no longer existed.",
          "My environmental consciousness intensified (I convinced friends to take a train instead of flying, and my family went vegan).",
          "I was told to notice no difference between me and the object; we're all qualities of awareness.",

          "Around 11:00 AM, I realized the dragonfly and the rock were one.",
          "The more one practices and progresses on their spiritual path, the more one understands that these experiences are a 'positive byproduct,' gifts from the Divine to be let go of, not to be identified with, lest one becomes stuck in spiritual growth and blocks the door to liberation.",
          "I had only a faint sense of 'I'; in the foreground was the experience of clarity, boundlessness, connection with everything.",

          "I repeatedly enter states of consciousness in which I experience on the one hand the lightness of uprightness and on the other hand the gravity in contact with the ground, connected with the feeling of the center.",
          "Extraordinarily ordinary, and a total game changer.",
          "During the silence, however, 'things are happening', a intoxicating liveliness that cannot be concretized except in yogic flying, i.e., impulses to take off and do so despite relaxation.",
          "I was everywhere and everything.",
          "I didn't feel separated from the outside world, but was part of the whole, in subtle movement with everything else, like a river, bright and light.",
          "From one moment to the next, I suddenly became a silent witness to my sensory perceptions and actions, e.g., playing with other children.",
          "These still existed and I still perceived them, but I was no longer identified with them.",

          "I also have no conception of human, living being, life, world, etc.",
          "These experiences of pure awareness are impossible to put into words.",
          "In fact, I really didn't even know I was in such a state, yet being in it, until the mind suddenly produced a few thoughts, which I observed as if they were phenomena outside myself.",
          "Silence was there and had its own consistency – it wasn't a lack of sound but rather an entity in itself.",
          "Effortlessly, in a way I've never experienced before.",
          "The experience I described above wasn't like this stopping of the breath and awareness of mind alone, which felt more like emptiness.",
          "Part of my mind automatically wondered if I was dreaming, and I instantly knew I was because my entire existence at that moment was just me, a light switch, and an intense, unconnected terror.",
          "The experience of the world feels a bit like watching a show, sounds and sights appear and disappear as if they were dancing around and I'm in the middle of that dance.",

          "It flows more sparsely, but the little is more precious, more fruitful and vital.",
          "There was a very small part (like a background, or like a spiderweb-thin thread) that still led back to the original awareness of myself.",
          "I have noticed this to be a constant in the experiences that have happened to me; I end up inside without realizing it, as long as I remain there, sensations of: unity, infinity, wonder, subtle joy, peace, expansion prevail; the phase of 'returning to myself' is all the more traumatic the more intense the state experienced has been.",
          "It's as if the kisser and the kissed merge in the kiss.",
          "This first occurrence I could rather describe as a unitary or enlightenment experience, however, it extended over many days and I best describe it as a 'first fall into the now'.",
          "I felt that it was so intrinsic and innate, so, how could it go?",
          "Objects are permeated with liveliness - visibly luminous.",
          "It's an impulse.",
          "The space between thoughts expands - to a free space within me.",

          "These sounds captivated and enchanted me.",
          "There was an intensity, vibrancy, and luminosity to all objects, and this realization itself was extremely pleasant; I was aware of this pleasantness.",
          "In this state, I can sit completely motionless for hours without thoughts and needs, but wide awake.",
          "During some of my meditations I reach a state where my consciousness is a vast dark void where there's no difference between the void, emptiness and me.",
          "The moment I noticed that, it was already gone.",
          "On other occasions I felt the world very brightly with eyes open, and became aware of awareness itself and how the world is constructed within me, and I am only a dot-like vanishing point for the experienced world.",

          "There was no good or bad, no opposites—everything was one unity, yet each thing completely particular.",
          "Emotions that arose in me were, from a normal perspective, negative.",
          "Linguistic expressions, when I use them, then appear to me as suggestions that guide me, direct my attention and point beyond themselves into another area of my consciousness.",
          "Then again, there was not a feeling of separation between knower and known; if anything it was that those two things felt the same.",
          "It was a falling into and through itself, through several layers of human experience worlds to a layer where nothing and everything was at the same time.",
          "It is a special energetic revitalization that refreshes all the senses, the entire brain, the spine and the body.",
          "From this, a state of total lack of desire, fulfillment beyond fulfillment, incredible inner peace, which may remain for a long time, quickly arises.",
          "There I experience myself as pure consciousness, as light—a perception of supernatural brightness.",
          "This 'I' is much bigger than this body, and I am contained within this larger 'I'.",
          "Since I hadn't found anything, I became increasingly nervous; I thought I had done something fundamentally wrong and, above all, misunderstood.",
          "The normal thing for me is to experience sights and scenes while feeling like I am experiencing them from where 'I' stood.",
          "Lets me be calm, timeless, \"there\" - yes, in the here and now.",
          "I started muddying the water again, not noticing it.",
          "I also had a relatively similar but slightly different experience during a particularly conscious awakening, during a period of solitary hiking over several days.",
          "I also saw a great light over a park.",
          "But as long as I remain \"awake\", i.e., undistracted, it is clearly distinguishable that I can remain as an observer in the silence, even if there is a lot of movement in the mind.",
          "The body loses its boundaries, it moves effortlessly, although these movements, if one were to perform them with pressure and intention, would be very strenuous.",
          "I am her, but she is only a small part, an outward projection of something much, much larger.",
          "When I emerged from that state I felt as though the bottom had fallen out of my sense of self identity.",
          "Because these experiences are unmistakable, they remain in memory.",
          "When the corresponding state sets in, it is like seeing the seeing, or the awareness of being aware.",
          "Little by little the teacher started to bring us back and when I left there, I felt that I was full of everything, I didn't need anything.",
          "Without effort, not separate.",

          "Due to the very deep relaxation, there is also no impulse to question one's own sense of self (e.g., \"Who am I?",
          "Nothing that isn't nothing, though.",
          "And in that moment I am part of all that.",
          "Later on stopped publishing the book and related activity.",
          "I can then be there and simply experience what is happening, and sometimes less and less happens in my mind, and I experience the gaps very strongly.",
          "Again, there was often a dissolution, an expansion of consciousness beyond the body's boundaries.",
          "The participants were tasked with finding their true selves and sharing this at the end of the session.",
          "I don't experience the body as a flowing river of sensations, but I experience *experience* as a flowing river of experience, more or less broad—encompassing anything from a vast swath or a hyper-focused pinprick of present arising.",
          "I have learned to direct my attention during Zazen meditation to the mind itself, not to the contents of the mind (i.e., thoughts, sensory stimuli, or anything concrete).",
          "During the break in the meditation retreat: Everything is contained in everything, including the sense of self.",
          "I wouldn't consider myself proficient, but I see and derive benefit from whatever brief moments I get.",
          "At first it is simply surprising, because it is a kind of elevation, yes, actually incredibly uplifting in every respect.",
          "I felt it so strongly that I almost broke down out of lightness and also sort of missing the person who I thought always existed but now knew never existed to begin with.",
          "The relative 'I' was gone, and I remained alone.",
          "And in the moment, a tension came over me as my normal mode of feeling myself and the world was reestablished.",
          "Objects and people around me are no longer separate; my body is just another field of sensation with awareness in it.",
          "There was no longer any limit.",
          "They were very gentle, rhythmic pulses; I almost wanted to say they were sounds.",
          "I call this place \"my inner fortress\".",
          "After opening my eyes, the peace and fullness often continue, a feeling of bliss pervades my waking state.",
          "You then turn attention to what your reflection is looking at.",
          "Before starting the climb, I had thought about the problem of free will, and in this state I had an intuitive understanding and overwhelming awareness that 'I'/my brain controls my movements, but at the same time everything around me and in my body simply follows the laws of physics.",
          "At least that was my feeling, an end is not foreseeable at first.",
          "Everything was connected; no 'I', no body, pure Being.",
          "The experience/trip itself was very intense, emotional, and charged.",
          "Unfortunately, this experience probably only lasted a few seconds.",
          "I stood and 'watched' this but it was not 'me' doing the watching.",
          "It was blindingly obvious that some things simply were 'so'.",
          "In my meditation, I practice a technique and let go more and more to come into our natural state of consciousness.",
          "My experience was through mindful meditation.",
          "In another meditation, prompted by the teacher, I deeply questioned the meaning of 'I exist' and 'being and nothingness.'",
          "I also find the state, even after years, to be extremely fulfilling, nourishing and blissful.",
          "Tactile sensations and frog sounds were generated in the same field of consciousness, without inner/outer distinction.",
          "Who is it that hears?",
          "This helps me to approach situations in daily life in the same way.",
          "I repeatedly experience the connection with myself, the people around me, the world and the universe and again with myself.",
          "This oneness with my environment and my environment with me felt like fullness and emptiness all at once.",
          "A 'wakeful wholeness' was perceptible.",
          "This was 7 months ago but still stands as a high point of experience.",
          "Then, just as suddenly, I was completely present again, more so than ever before, and in that presence, my son was born.",
          "Suddenly there was no more space between me and the experiences, it was all very full and I was very confused because I was simultaneously overwhelmed by so much \"input\" and yet very indifferent, neutral, curious about it.",
          "It filled the whole body, in the field everything was slower, simpler and clearer.",
          "A blissful state of dense and at the same time light, bright fullness, of the whole being, of the body-awareness in the vibrating body space during open awareness meditation.",
          "It felt as if everything was inside me, merging into a benevolent and pleasant field.",
          "The berries, the street, the houses and I and my movement were just there, were a unity without a name.",
          "In addition, I had several experiences, always at night, of perceiving a light with my eyes closed.",
          "All that has been and all that is yet to be in a timeless \"moment\" at an empty \"place\" on the tip of a needle in the now.",
          "Like entering a completely different state of aggregation, but at the same time so fundamental that it also feels completely normal – because it was always invisibly present as the basis of all experiences.",
          "As if attempting to stand in the boat with wobbling legs, I still had awareness.",
          "But from the depths of being, an insight arose: \"This is only the beginning, not the end.\"",
          "Then you realize, wait, I'm not a subject without these objects of consciousness.",
          "Time seemed to stop, and I was awestruck.",
          "I will try to describe it like this: In my normal experience, I – despite better knowledge and also despite this experience – have the feeling that \"I\" experience something.",
          "I knew that in this state nothing bad could happen to me.",
          "I consciously chose this sound during the earlier stages of the practice.",
          "I could feel this awareness getting pulled back into body details or feelings; I had to gently 'sit back' into it or return to narrative.",
          "I didn't know if, for example, my arms were above or below my legs.",
          "I felt as if I were in an empty room from which I could decide what I wanted to look at next.",
          "It simply happened for some reason, and I found myself in it.",
          "The experience of perception is shaped as oneness between the perceiver (subject) and the perceived (object).",
          "At the beginning of my experience, the golden light of the rising sun blessed me, but then this light was within me and everywhere, and I was everywhere this light, boundless, blissful.",
          "Since this experience, I have been able to return there again and again.",
          "While I have never had this experience in the complete absence of other objects, this awareness feels completely independent of the objects (e.g., thoughts, sensations) that come and go.",
          "In this respect, I would describe it as pure.",
          "A feeling of a kind of \"aura\" of the significance of these moments.",
          "I also found that the awareness would move from spacious clear light to focused (closed) clear light when aware of thoughts arising.",
          "I notice details that I wouldn't before, like how sounds are made of many separate layers of sounds, or the parallax effect of the relationship between the movement of closer and farther objects (if I'm walking).",
          "I experience myself as body consciousness.",
          "This feeling flows through my body.",
          "I thought \"this is strange, this must be a non-dual experience\".",
          "There is a sense of self but it is light.",
          "It is something that straightens my back, makes me open my eyes and breathe deeply.",
          "There was no longer the difference between me, the tea, the smell.",
          "Around 30 minutes, I tried to 'look behind myself,' as in Dzogchen teachings, where awareness is primordial, behind everything.",
          "Right before the complete experience, I had a visual image that my I was falling apart.",
          "Though the first experience of Peace did not last longer than four or five days, it removed many misconceptions I had had about happiness and spirituality.",
          "It was completely effortless and easy and in its own way PERFECT.",
          "It's like drawing deep strength and refueling.",
          "Time passed, but this sensation felt insignificant, creating a sense of 'static flow.'",
          "The thoughts become still and an awareness of flowing presence arises.",
          "It's so beautiful.",
          "One becomes calmer, more relaxed.",
          "Peace was present with eyes closed and eyes open.",
          "I have a habit of trying to journal these types of experiences, so here is a snippet from some weeks back: I have stopped.",
          "It is interesting that in this state there was \"no one\" anymore.",
          "But I am not in a fixed state but more so of air, or something very spacious.",
          "Later, a state of wakeful presence sets in, a brief moment of emptiness that knows no I, the world is one.",
          "But this is only a transitional stage.",
          "There were situations in which this awareness seemed to come from within me, and situations in which a force from outside seemed to open my eyes.",
          "I wish you well in your inquiries.",
          "I perceived my limits, the people, the room, feeling like a newborn.",
          "This experience persists.",
          "I intensely feel my dream body, the wind on my skin, the warmth, the smell coming from the trees, but at the same time I'm connected to everything.",
          "Timelessness, in the sense that past, present, and future are intrinsically connected.",
          "The light and the awareness became hyper-present and I felt more awake than ever during normal waking consciousness.",
          "I closed my eyes and just followed it.",
          "Just as one can recognize the images on the eyes as such, and the edge of our visual field represents the transition of experience to the container of experience.",
          "Otherwise the sense of me as a person was very broad - I was completely aware of myself and in harmony with what was happening and the surroundings.",
          "My body perception was beyond precise and imprecise; my body was everywhere without limits, warm flowing, expansive, merged, simultaneously awake and with fine perception of every detail without hyperfocus on one detail.",
          "It has already become night; the only sound is heavy rain on the roof of the meditation hall.",
          "It was amazed looking around, amazed listening to the silence, just breathing.",
          "I remain in this state until it slowly subsides, then return to the walking meditation.",
          "The impossible happened.",
          "There is no limitation and it is a feeling of power and charge, at the same time a lightness and agility.",
          "I relived my life, or what was important in it, but all at once, without a linear or chronological order, I relived everything as if objectively, morally, by clearly realizing the value of everything I had done, feeling the sensations of others, from the position of those or that which was receiving good and bad from me.",
          "After such experiences, my mind felt cleared, less \"white noise\" of the \"default system\"; I knew what I had to do, knew what was good for me (like taking cold showers in winter, wearing only a t-shirt outside when it was -15°C, that felt great).",
          "Visual impressions with open eyes are then more distant, like a picture, and with closed eyes it seems brighter to me than before, regardless of the existing light sources.",
          "I need my eyes closed, and my sense of self disappears.",
          "Everything became 'one' thing.",
          "I didn't remember having an experience of senses first, let alone awareness, for more than an hour total.",
          "For a brief moment I felt myself simultaneously in the here and now and in infinity.",
          "I felt elevated to a higher plane, where in peace I could witness emptiness of the mind.",
          "I went there.",
          "Even though thoughts, sensations etc.",
          "The sound of the wind was part of consciousness.",
          "While in that state, I felt a great sense of peace, but then, when I emerged, an enormous unease surfaced.",
          "We are one.",
          "However, if you are involved with Hindu philosophy, there is the term Atman.",
          "Aligned, my perceptions were simple.",
          "I had to open my eyes because it was a cloudy day.",
          "Perhaps the words \"clarity\", \"simplicity\", and \"openness\" best describe my state.",
          "I have self-referential thoughts again now, though not as severe and I still have that lightness experience, though it waxes and wanes.",
          "Nothing can happen to me and I feel connected to everything around me.",
          "Everything felt like one.",
          "Before that, I heard many crows screaming in the field and the loud street noise of a nearby road.",
          "The experience itself was simultaneous extremely profound while remaining incredibly mundane.",
          "The experience is abstract, but also very concrete.",
          "My body sensation is often 'very hot' = I get very warm.",
          "Atman represents the pure being of the individual.",
          "Often I only perceive black silence or empty space.",
          "More precisely: The entire inner stage constantly moves into the center of perception.",
          "What I consider essential was the letting go.",
          "I now feel that nothing new was discovered, but it can now be seen for the first time.",
          "I sat there for what turned out to be an hour before regaining normal consciousness.",
          "After a strenuous hike and climbing an observation platform, I was suddenly alone on my section of the platform.",
          "This happened without worry and fear.",
          "Where the concepts of things disappeared.",
          "All the context, baggage, and deception around communication evaporated.",
          "I have a very gentle feeling, like boundless love and empathy.",
          "For the first 25 years of my life, my focus of attention had always been on thoughts, the sensual world in the background.",
          "During times of more intense meditation or generally longer contemplative stays, e.g., in a monastery, there are occasionally physical sensations at night with the experience of \"waves\" of energy flowing up and down in the body, and the moment they are perceived by waking consciousness, they are over.",
          "I always find this refreshing and it feels like I've been reset to zero.",
          "It's like a light bulb that slowly turns on, and parallel to its turning on, there is a sensation of presence; at this point it becomes difficult to describe.",
          "I would like to add that it was an intensive experience of the present - so to speak, to its innermost corner of space and time: however, as if the self had been \"removed\".",
          "The experience of fullness/wholeness was primarily characterized by a 'balance of body and mental processes' – i.e., neither purely physical nor mental.",
          "It was space-like, and with a conviction that \"normal\" states of mind involve endless dissatisfaction.",
          "At that moment, I felt for the first time that I am not my thoughts, but the invisible thinker.",
          "I don't feel strong peace, joy, or detachment—no high feelings, rather 'pleasant,' 'liberated,' or 'at rest'.",
          "These experiences have, however, been mostly negative (including sleep paralysis, sensed evil presences etc.)",
          "It was quite brief; I didn't have too many thoughts during the experience, just telling myself \"look at your torso and legs\", and then I lowered my head to look; it was as if my body was part of the world, just like an object.",
          "But that's only because of the light penetrating through my eyelids.",
          "It was so real and compelling that I couldn't refuse.",
          "My state can be described as one of full presence, in the sense that during a 20-minute practice, for 3 minutes or so I was totally in the practice.",
          "It's now blazingly clear that letting go doesn't mean not doing.",
          "In between the thoughts, pure awareness is utterly without conceptual content and I feel very relaxed.",
          "The experience made me joyful and also a little afraid.",
          "Meditation in the style of Za-Zen, completely permeable without demarcation from the surroundings, high vigilance, joy and happiness.",
          "I felt the urgency to drop my state and adopt his to communicate.",
          "There is no edge—there is no razor line—that is just an idea—instead I find bursting bubbles of experience, of feeling, of percepts—from the micro to the all-encompassing macro—where all is revealed as profoundly one—meaningfully one—symphonically one.",
          "I suspect the disconnection from a fixed routine and life structure plus the intensive study of philosophical points on the nature of phenomena and mind contributed to the experience I had.",
          "Without content and conditions, without cause and form.",
          "As soon as I come into this thought pause for the first time, the environment is no longer within my experience.",
          "Experiences of overwhelming bliss – beyond body and everyday world (ascension experience during an accident).",
          "After half an hour of slow, deep breathing, I had a moment where I probably fell asleep for about two minutes.",
          "Like the ultimate escape from discursive thought.",
          "That said, in that realm of existence, I don't feel the need to do anything or be anywhere, just simply existing in a limbo.",
          "I had only one very slow thought passing by, as if it was passing inside the dark field, and it translates into something like - \"This is it.\"",
          "I was consciousness, pure and still.\"",
          "In Zazen, the feeling of no longer being separated from the world, of being able to feel like a stone or a plant.",
          "There was no distinction between subject (I) and object (birdsong).",
          "No verbal thoughts.",
          "That which cannot be put into words, since every description is inaccurate.",
          "asked whether the state was 'positive' or 'relaxed' or a 'feeling of unity' or the like, I couldn't answer at all or only with no, because the state simply wasn't there or nothing...",

          "At this point, tears came to my eyes and I began thinking and the experience dissipated.",
          "My mood was rather sad, desperate, hopeless.",
          "The experience of this awareness is timeless, and notions of space and time and temperature are absolutely meaningless and unthinkable in this experience.",
          "When you return from the experience to the normal waking state of consciousness with thoughts and sensory experiences, you feel energetically refreshed and vitalized.",
          "There's also an urge to smile.",

          "In principle, what near-death experiencers (I didn't know that back then) describe as connectedness, only without the feeling of connectedness and without the light and the relatives, but only \"as part of a greater whole\".",
          "Language cannot grasp the experience (as already stated in the question).",
          "- In this experience, the mind was so sharp that it could see clearly defined sensations at every point in the body?, the mind?",
          "Incidentally, I have already systematically coached someone into this experience twice.",
          "I tried not to cling to any thoughts, perceptions, or emotions.",
          "But it remains.",
          "The first time I experienced a state of consciousness clearly different from my daily experience, I felt strong unity and love—an observation of love and oneness without attachment or categories.",
          "That is the truth!",
          "I think I remember that this amazement also caused the experience to end.",
          "I'm conscious of this brief state and feel like I'm observing uninterrupted conscious awareness.",
          "It was also a perception of a complete, deep silence.",
          "To define one aspect, it's like filming someone's eye patterns as they view the graphic representation of a fractal.",
          "But a third time didn't come.",

          "A deeper state sets in when the emptiness withdraws into \"me\" onto itself and becomes aware of itself.",
          "Or full of compassion.",
          "This awareness was without words.",
          "Once during a guided fantasy journey, I was told, among other things, that there was light, bright radiant light in a forest clearing, and suddenly I myself was light.",
          "What is, naturally answers what is.",
          "Later I could realize that it contained the potential that everything could arise or be created... At first (the first few days) I only found this experience amusing and a bit funny, later it turned out that it completely transformed me, made me rethink and turn my whole life (concept) upside down and thus became one of the most important experiences in my life.",
          "Other times the state already exists and only gradually becomes conscious.",
          "I love that :-) and miss it in 3D reality.",
          "The disidentification of thoughts and emotions was amazing; I stopped feeling thought.",
          "My perceptions were very weak and only became conscious towards the end of the event.",
          "Even if this state is without thoughts, feelings or other content, for me this experience of pure consciousness, the space and timelessness, is also the experience of an unchanging immaterial being, which I experience as fullness, infinite feeling of happiness.",
          "But when there is success, I manage to sustain this state that allows a sensation of presence, peace, freedom, fullness to manifest.",
          "When I managed to open my eyes (which wasn't easy, as the light was so dazzling that I could hardly relax my squeezed eyes), it was dark in the room.",

          "After half an hour I allow myself another 2-5 minutes to reorient myself; I have the feeling of having been completely \"gone\" without falling asleep.",
          "I dropped alcohol and smoking without any effort, not even wishing to stop drinking and smoking, I just kinda did it.",
          "I was both intensely relieved by being free from the separation, but also shocked by the self-evident ordinariness of it.",
          "So I think I was feeling a little despondent, thinking this was another waste of time.",
          "A connection ran from my crown to my toes, uniting body, mind, and soul.",
          "It occurred during a meditation, a perfectly clear, calm attentiveness like a clear vibration of the whole body, which is perceptible as such but not limited or identity-forming, a timelessness and spacelessness and yet clear awareness of sounds without reaction or that 'something' would follow.",
          "The ego boundaries, primarily felt physically, expand into infinite vastness, and all experience contents rise in pure awareness like an air bubble in champagne, or they hang in the air like a bird in free flight in the sky.",

          "I or It rests.",

          "Best regards, I.N",
          "It is hard to put into words because it is primarily a unity experience.",
          "In another one I felt the sense of self was present but a buffer of awareness has formed between me and my sensations such that pain, heat, hardness weren't FELT but not like SEEN and their intensity had no impact due to the cushion of an awareness of awareness.",
          "It lasted about 15 to 20 minutes and then I 'fell' back into the normal state.",
          "Conscious activity separates this into two components.",

          "The body was no longer necessarily consciously present.",

          "I felt like a conscious being; everything was included in this large, cosmic 'body' of mine, and a very subtle yet intense sense of happiness and bliss was present.",
          "It's like a groping, a tactile sense with ever-changing quality.",
          "The state of the \"observer\" occurred, for example, once during a presentation shortly after the beginning of TM, completely surprisingly.",

          "Subject and object arise from the folding of the fundamental substance, the observer arbitrarily placed on one side.",
          "Sometimes the sense of joy feels almost too intense as if there is tension around an unusual feeling.",
          "And that led to the fact that I could accept myself as a person very well.",
          "Unity and nothingness, perfectly balanced.",
          "It was as if everything disappeared, body, mind, space and time, but awareness itself was still present.",
          "In the foreground of perception is not any kind of limitation, but unity and interconnectedness.",
          "That was the transition into unity, the absolute awareness, the end of perception, the beginning of being.",

          "I didn't experience the \"who\", I only experienced awareness of the sights and scenes.",
          "I was one with this experience.",
          "The difference is that these experiences of shifting focal points each approximate each other in ways that feel similarly natural to associations such as a book and computer are writing instruments.",
          "It is then as if the attention simply lies in the attention itself.",
          "Afterwards, of course, I read a lot about it and classify the whole thing as a spiritual crisis that, continuously weakening, lasted about 7 years.",
          "When my self-allotted time to see if there was anything in this enlightenment thing, I decided to give it one last go before giving this whole thing up.",
          "There was no sense of naming these things or of knowing what they were but a distinct sense of change.",
          "Sense of self utterly absent, and yet able to function when appropriate to take action or speak.",
          "The special thing about such experiences is that they are experienced even more clearly, unequivocally, and directly than sensory perceptions.",
          "I participated in a workshop on Headless Vision (Douglas Harding) and we did the exercise of pointing our finger towards our eyes to redirect our attention while keeping in mind that above my shoulders, there is the world.",

          "Then, gradual relaxation.",
          "I felt peace and quiet and contentment, but also a feeling of being lost in the vast space.",
          "During stressful times, I don't get into the state, no matter how long I sit.",
          "It has happened in several really dangerous accident situations—I have never had so much as a scratch, but without this, what I call body awareness, I could just as well be dead.",
          "It felt like I could close my eyes and my awareness wouldn't change.",

          "The end of the gap happened when a very quiet background noise appeared.",
          "It is as if a ray emanates from my forehead and at the same time this individual ray of sight is \"surrounded\" by an infinite vastness, lightness.",
          "I find it difficult to put these in words other than a direct coming into touch with and knowing of experience as it unfolds including all sense modalities including thinking.",

          "It's difficult to put into words; in any case, through meditation I can create conditions (by relaxing into the moment) and it comes or not, like grace; a strong aspect of letting go, until there is no one left to let go, no inside or outside, no one who is doing well or badly, although in the background there may be a feeling in the body, occasionally thoughts, perceptions of the environment, these are simultaneously not there and everything, perfect birth; it doesn't last and has no time; it is perfectly there and nowhere, there is no place where it could be or could not be, there is nothing outside this being, to call it being is already too much, often accompanied by tears, and if there is a feeling, then gratitude, but not for anything or anyone, but gratitude itself (Do you understand what I mean?",
          "Under these conditions, I was able to follow the instructions for achieving meditative deepening up to the 5th Dhyana.",
          "In another experience, while meditating, I grasped the 'question' itself, the question as a phenomenon, without content; it emerged incredibly, as if I were noticing it for the first time.",
          "But when I did get up to move I saw that I did not move.",
          "At the end of the meditation, it felt appropriate to leave this state and return to the reality of the room.",
          "As I got up, the unconscious mechanism finally relaxed and gave way to a thickness.",

          "I said the most vivid experiences I had were in contact with nature.",
          "The experience occurred during a Zen Sesshin, in which I could otherwise only sit in great pain.",

          "With the Siddhis, I experience the object of attention merging into the Self to produce the result of the Siddhi, which is just a manifestation of the Self.",

          "I have had many experiences of \"pure awareness,\" but only the following three were lasting and the most profound: 1+2.",
          "On the second-to-last day of an 8-day Zen retreat, I was suddenly overcome by a force, tears flowing, not from sadness but from a deep, overwhelming happiness (though that's not quite the right word).",
          "For several years, experiences of pure consciousness have been present in most meditations.",
          "The first time I was sitting on a mountain, with two children playing in the background.",

          "During meditation, I experienced a complete dissolution of my physical and mental existence.",
          "During Vipassana meditation, near the end of an hour-long session while body scanning, the conceptual awareness of body sensations slowed and stopped.",

          "I sat in a meadow.",
          "I also sometimes spontaneously experience other mystical states, such as those that I would describe with the Hindu term \"tat tvam asi\", in which it is clear to me that I am identical with everything that is somehow existent and conceivable - or experiences of oneness, in which I immediately feel the unity of all being.",
          "In the long term, these episodes of pure consciousness dominated the following periods of my life: from 1966, the stillness of pure consciousness; from 1976, unlimited pure consciousness; from 1981, the inherent dynamism of pure consciousness.",
          "During my meditation course I felt suddenly very peaceful, not judging, feeling whole, homecoming.",
          "In my meditations, long periods of effortless being often arise, without thoughts, with deep physical rest, often coupled with long periods of breath-holding or VERY subtle breathing activity.",
          "In meditation, my experienced state was characterized above all by the absence of something: pressing thoughts, memories, worries, distractions of the senses, etc.",
          "I often have such experiential states.",
          "I've gotten into the habit of doing a short meditation every morning and evening.",
          "Because episodes of pure awareness sometimes spontaneously occurred, some people kept their distance, lived in mountains and forests, sat quietly under trees and walked very slowly in order not to ruin it.",
          "This also happened for 5 minutes during another mindfulness retreat.",
          "I have meditated a lot in my life, but I have never experienced anything like that in my meditations.",

          "With TM meditation (mantra technique) I reach a state with very little breath, in my case now mostly connected with a feeling of physical well-being that spreads through the whole body, especially concentrated in the hands.",
          "I sat for some time with my thoughts and the mantra.",
          "I have experienced awareness of awareness which is moving from a separate sense of self to have awareness detach from its identification and then become aware of awake awareness rather than thought, internal contents or external objects as primary.",

          "It's hard to describe, but I'll try: My first experience, after months of meditation, started with mild unease and anxiety during meditation.",

          "I have had a few awareness experiences during short meditations/concentration practice as a conclusion to my daily yoga practice.",
          "During my six-month meditation training, I went into the city and instantly began seeing my face in everyone there; my experience was being everything.",
          "The session begins normally, relaxed sitting and breathing, awareness of the space, those present, the breath, the concentration.",

          "Almost weekly, I reach a moment of 'pure consciousness' (or what I believe to be) in meditation.",
          "I was meditating, either sitting or lying down, at home (though I don't recall the exact location or body position).",
          "All I can say is that things were still happening - the sounds of birds outside, the creaking floor in the meditation hall, the sight of the wooden floor in front of me (open eyes meditation).",
          "If it is important to your research I can check in my notes to see if I have precise dates.",
          "Going into \"silent retreat\" or “taking refuge” really was a quality of mind, mental motion blending into silence – not something you, the parasitic ego-manager, did in the outside world!",
          "The most astonishing thing about this experience or this state (which lasted over 2 hours) was how normal it felt, in the sense of \"yes, of course, that's how it is\".",
          "Later on, others tried to get into such states by slavishly copying the observable outward behaviour that was caused in some by the spontaneous experience of pure awareness.",
          "Therefore, I have mostly understood my Zen practice as not focusing my attention on the inner observer (the lonely spectator in the cinema), but forgetting the seat in the cinema and instead re-identifying myself with the actor on the screen and the ever-unfinished script.",
          "Something tells me I need to increase the 60 minutes (35 minutes + 5 minutes yoga + 25 minutes).",
          "Like the more I can quiet my physical and mental stress and anxiety I can uncover more of this baseline reality of experience.",
          "I meditate daily, but this state of pure being comes when I lie down to sleep in the afternoon, I doze off, and suddenly I'm wide awake, but I don't know who I am or where I am.",
          "In my Vipassana practice I observe both my main meditation object (e.g., breath, sounds) and the awareness of the object.",

          "I walked around the meditation center and through a dense Oregon forest.",
          "I was meditating while waiting for my car at a car wash, staring out the window and simultaneously connected with my reflection as I expanded my field of vision and tried to look back at the meditator, and everything became one and separate from my thoughts.",
          "He first led a guided meditation and then a silent meditation.",
          "The experience was pleasant and for the first time while meditating I had the feeling that I could go on meditating forever.",

          "During a meditation week I sat by the lake, not meditating.",
          "Every time after Transcendental Meditation, I have a feeling that people look at me and smile at me and are friendly to me, although there is no particular reason to be friendly without reason.",

          "It happened during one of my meditation sessions.",
          "I was practicing Zen meditation.",
          "The experiences described are much more accessible when I go into my meditation with a completely rested and settled mind and body.",
          "I felt the wind through my branches (as the trees), insects crawling through me (as the earth).",
          "This flow was also observed in unintentional body stretching.",
          "My strongest experience occurred during a 5-day sesshin, on the last day.",
          "I was aware that I was meditating and that this was happening to me and that it was not normal, although it was.",
          "From this state I think the Sutras, stop thinking them, and then experience (not as perfectly as described by Patanjali) the respective effect of the Sutra.",
          "During a period of sitting meditation, lasting about 2.5 hours, at some point my consciousness became aware of awareness, rather than my meditation object (breath).",
          "I started meditating in nature.",
          "* I learned the technique of Transcendental Meditation according to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1976 at the age of 13 of my own accord...",
          "The experience I refer to came during a period of frequent Vipassana and Zen retreats, but also a time of attending to people in psychosis where I often got little rest or sleep except for meditation.",
          "Metta, i.e., sharing it with the world, all the feelings of peace and awareness that arose during meditation, connects with the world, with all that is – in peace.",
          "After about 6 months of using it, as I was walking to work, I started to repeat some instructions in my head as if a form of walking meditation based on his instructions.",
          "While I do not know when in the practice the particular experience occurred, I distinctly recall a very unique experience that has not since occurred in my meditation practice.",
          "Below is an extract copied from my journal—a rough account of an experience of sitting meditation at the Mahabodhi Temple, Bodhgaya, India, including some observations on the environmental conditions, which I was aware of as distraction at first, and then as fully integrated and seamlessly wonderful elements of the now.",
          "The bare trees creeked loudly overhead, as if the wind was going to take them down.",
          "Another situation that occurred during meditation: I sat there with my eyes closed and noticed how I was leaving my body.",
          "I have experienced this state several times with meditation; it spontaneously occurs and shortly thereafter dissipates as my sense of self returns and tries to claim or investigate and normally prolong the state of mind, which seems to destroy it.",
          "Then I started to wonder about the situation, and then my intellect returned with the thought that I meditate so much and that I could simply be sad today.",
          "I decided to go to a rooftop patio to meditate before going home.",
          "These moments occurred both during meditations and during my hypnosis training, i.e., in states of deep relaxation.",
          "For me, the meditation practice that catalyzed it (and semi-reliably does so) is deep, slow breathing at a very low rate—3 or 4 breaths a minute.",
          "I didn't find/experience anything \"in me\" that was paying attention; all that happened was that I experienced seeing the tree, more vividly.",
          "I can intentionally bring about such experiences when my mind is reasonably calm and focused, but I can usually only hold them briefly before mental objects, i.e.",
          "Walking to the train, passing a small pine forest, I felt a merging with my surroundings, especially the trees.",
          "I often have these perceptions in my meditation practice.",
          "I was pretty shattered and finding it hard to concentrate in meditation.",
          "During a 25-minute meditation session, I spontaneously entered a state of boundless perception, feeling one with everything—pure, reflection-free perception in complete relaxation and wonder.",
          "At the beginning of the meditation, my state of consciousness changed, it was a oneness with everything while simultaneously being aware of my body, an inner peace, a deep feeling of happiness, like a pulsing through the whole body, but very gentle.",
          "All my experiences of pure awareness in years of Atma Kriya Yoga practice, both as a teacher and student, are due to divine grace, for which I am infinitely grateful.",
          "The experiences occurred during guided meditations by the spiritual teacher Christian Meyer.",
          "This subsided after some time, whereby I had no perception of time during the experience.",
          "In this state I very often experience Gyan Shakti, a state of knowingness which is also present during rest after meditation, as well as some time afterwards.",
          "In the initial phase of meditation many thoughts and feelings.",
          "While meditating, I often feel less dependent or less influenced by the content of my perceptions.",
          "I sit alone in a meditation hall, with my breath, breath by breath.",
          "While I slowly walked back under the trees, attention and the way it settled on perceptual objects had a gentle, almost tender quality to it.",
          "Returning to the zendo, I realized I was the floor, the grass, the trees, the people, the entire world.",
          "I first noticed that the experiences of pure awareness that I remember most concretely are made in meditation, and that they are reproducible in a similar quality, as I described in the questionnaire, which is always consciously present for me in the background.",
          "Without inducing the described state through meditation, I was able to spend my life thought-free for several days.",
          "– I'm meditating, suddenly I have the feeling that my body has disappeared, has expanded infinitely and my mind is everywhere.",
          "It happened on my first retreat, it was day 4 of a Vipassana course, the first group session after the Vipassana introduction with 'sharpened' rules: 'from now on we add another item to our daily groupsittings, we call it adhitana, strong determination'.",
          "With exercises of pure consciousness (awareness) that is aware of itself – these experiences regularly occur: - from one moment to the next complete relief - a light (almost \"childlike\") feeling of joy - temporary experience of brightness, space-lessness - spontaneous, sometimes ingenious \"ideas\" (solution approaches) from \"nothing\" Immediately afterwards: - significantly improved memory - clarity of thought - better body-motor skills...",
          "I remember well a meditative 'highlight' in which I found myself clear, open, empty, free of thoughts, in pure being, permeated by timelessness and strong pulsating, non-tactile light.",
          "Sitting for 45 minutes, then 30 minutes walking meditation, alternating.",
          "Given the very positive results on both fronts, any experience of selflessness is just a bonus, and I would meditate even were such states not possible.",
          "Nor do I stay in monastery as written in the above para.",
          "However, all these experiences described CANNOT—and I would like to emphasize this because it may run counter to the assumptions of the study—be separated from the background of the meditation system through which this experience was made possible.",
          "There was a feeling as if I could sit in that state for many hours, but it was reduced in its intensity in a matter of minutes.",
          "I have experienced the state of pure awareness in meditation, but also in everyday life.",
          "Meditation in the middle of a week-long silent retreat.",
          "My experience with the state of \"pure consciousness\" was complete self-acceptance without any hope and fear in the form of concepts.",
          "This is a very special experience every time, which I try to integrate into my waking state.",
          "Increased meditation time brought on body pain (tight right hip).",
          "I don't really know how much time has passed, but after that the expansion of my awareness slowly returned to usual.",
          "I just sat there and wasn't aware that I was meditating.",
          "While walking and being in the wintry forest with snow-covered trees and ice on rocks, it happened to me several times that I was inseparable from my surroundings, was both observer and non-observer, part of the whole, felt the trees, the ice within me, or was inseparable from it.",
          "When I then looked at the trees moving in the wind, I had the feeling of merging with them and the surroundings.",
          "I followed Mind Illuminated's introductory steps: Motivation, Goals, Expectations, Diligence, Distractions, and Posture.",
          "I maintained this boundless feeling for several minutes, but couldn't regain it when I tried to.",
          "At some point I was back in the normal state, I cannot remember the transition back from this clear perception.",
          "I have had these experiences now for several years, always when my mind was completely settled.",
          "At some point, I felt my body again, thoughts and feelings returned.",
          "The outstanding characteristic of my experience was a radically changed perception of reality (through a kind of merging with the wind and the trees and their movement) (resolution of boundaries) towards a perception without different objects or subject.",
          "In the following years, this \"experience\" stabilized, i.e., pure consciousness is also aware of itself in everyday life.",
          "It took place during a longer retreat.",
          "The experience that I used as the basis for answering the questions in this study occurred during a longer session of meditation (Vipassanā) (approximately 45 minutes), in which I started by performing a body scan, before being mindful of my breath, and then moving to notice sounds in my environment.",
          "I like this and that's why I like to meditate.",
          "For me, from childhood on, dance was a kind of meditation without knowing that one would (could) call my experiences that way afterwards.",
          "Our ethics teacher spoke months later about a spiritual org.",
          "I was in a room, with a beautiful view of a meadow and a tree.",
          "As the sense of self diminishes in meditation, self-observation and object-viewing disappear (thoughts vanish), I experience a passive presence, the observer between my eyes becoming stiller, relaxed, sinking into itself.",
          "It was during a group session.",
          "I immediately achieved the state and felt blissful for about 15 minutes.",
          "I was studying a text of Nagarjuna, rolling my mind over certain four-line stanzas for hours at a time.",
          "Rituals, liturgies, some of the daily routine in monasteries and retreat centres actually resembled cargo cults, I now thought.",
          "During meditation, I focused on an object—I don't remember what—my perception shifted toward brightness, a feeling of oneness with the surrounding space, and beyond the limits of physical space.",
          "After the extremely vivid memory I \"returned\" to the forest and existed in this hyper aware state for an hour or so.",
          "I focused on the instructions of both in my meditations.",
          "It's very rare, however, and I'm not entirely sure what enables it—could be level of stress, exercise that day, clear headedness.",
          "In another experience, while meditating, I suddenly grasped the existing 'ALL' WITHOUT foundation.",
          "I once experienced a special form of pure awareness after consuming cannabis: I had to lie flat on the floor and lost the feeling of control over my body, as if consciousness completely separated from it.",
          "A line of prayer comes into consciousness spontaneously: Into your hands be beginning and end, let everything be laid.",
          "I saw them \"through and through\" as Chan Master Linji said of his students.",

          "I would like to describe two different situations: I practice Vipassana daily.",
          "My first experience of pure awareness was the longest, at the end of a 3-hour meditation session.",
          "My most frequent experience is the experience of pure consciousness in the midst of everyday life: whenever I direct my attention to it with particular intensity, but also in the midst of doing things at work.",
          "There is a feeling of luminous unity with reduced breathing activity, but not from nothing, but after performing certain meditation and pranayama techniques.",
          "During a long monastic retreat, one morning I chose to eat my only meal alone, near a pond.",
          "One could speak of a warm, quiet, and also luminous state (but since I meditate with my eyes open, there is light anyway).",
          "Then I have experiences outside the formal session in the retreat.",
          "Moments of great feelings of happiness also occurred more often over the years in meditation... very pulsating, very stimulating, but at the same time I was still, and the body as such was \"not\" perceptible, at least not in the usual, almost sluggish way.",
          "During meditation, I redirect attention to the self.",
          "Meditation session this morning.",
          "During a longer seated meditation following a moving meditation with Qigong, I had the indescribably beautiful experience of only perceiving light in the room, of which I myself was a part.",
          "Everything is okay as it is, without ifs and buts—this is an absolutely desirable state, not only in meditation but ideally every day.",
          "Nevertheless, meditations on the retreat were uniformly deep, long and still, with easy access to 5th& 6th jhanas.",
          "My first experience of inner awareness happened shortly after learning the Transcendental Meditation technique.",
          "during sitting meditation with open eyes, a long-lasting state of very clear and bright perception, very connected with being, at peace with being",
          "In the meditation before the actual experience there were instructions from off-stage such as: Don't waste your time.",
          "Sometimes I put myself into this \"state\" in stressful situations.",
          "This could be in meditation as well as in everyday activities (but in a long silent retreat).",
          "Before I meditated, I was in a depressive state, filled with great sadness and heaviness.",
          "Occasionally, very rarely, I have experienced a brief state of clarity during meditation where the usual case of buffeting between several observed sensations falls into a condition of equilibrium and I am, for just a moment, at a place where my attention is neither tied to anything nor pulled into one or more directions.",
          "The first time I felt anything similar to pure awareness was during the reading of the book The Power of Now.",

          "The experience happened during a sitting meditation session in a 7-day Zen retreat.",

          "I can become one (united) with plants that I look at, etc.",
          "The bandhas of Hatha Yoga are excellent for getting out of the state of \"talking mind\" and relaxing my body.",
          "In this state, I felt like I would know how to inhabit it forever, but after what felt like 15 to 45 minutes later I started to feel I was gradually coming back to a normal state, which I did although I still felt joyful.",

          "I experience such phenomena very often in nature and in connection with people.",
          "The level of concentration was very high, magnet-like, and I noticed that I was meditating spontaneously/effortlessly/automatically and that I was awake (in other words, I was in dhyana or access concentration).",
          "Since I have meditated regularly every day for most of my life *(or rather \"transcended\"), the experience of \"pure consciousness\" is deeply rooted in my life feeling, so that I practically experience it 24/7.",
          "It has often happened so far that towards the end of a longer meditation session (at least 50-60 minutes, usually longer) and/or after or during a retreat I come into a strange state, where the impression arises of coming very close to something fundamental, unbelievable, essential, which then seems to withdraw from direct consciousness in a way.",

          "I fell asleep on a sunny autumn afternoon in a meadow.",
          "One must stop and be grounded, only then can the abduction into a non-material ALL-ONE-BEING happen... By the way, I had a striking number of such, as I like to call them because it aptly describes what I experienced, ALL-ONE 'meditation experiences' during my pregnancy.",
          "And also within the framework of my earlier Theravada Vipassana meditation practice, where the interpretative framework is also different, and this significantly shapes the experiential content.",

          "Another experience was also on a retreat (Zen): I experience timelessness.",
          "Therefore, for me, so-called 'meditation' is not connected with a special framework or a specific sitting posture.",

          "Since then, I've learned to 'lose my head' at will and other techniques (e.g., throwing my attention to a corner of the room and looking back), giving me the same wholeness/emptiness/fullness, eliminating the self and watching it reform as thoughts pattern.",

          "My concentration and inner clarity were strong, I perceived sensations on all sensory levels clearly and precisely.",
          "The \"giving\" and the \"taking\" felt very intentional... like something intelligent was providing me with a glimpse of something important.",
          "The watching 'me' simply observed the watched 'me' with calm and fascination as the watched 'me' simply existed quietly in a perfectly still state.",
          "If someone got irritated or angry with me, I saw them with great compassion and did not have the slightest bit of defensive emotionality.",
          "I was weightless in the space of infinite possibilities, a nobody in the blackness of the universe.",
          "I was completely relaxed and left the house.",
          "It was a feeling of incredible freedom and deepest bliss.",
          "Every sensory detail was more vivid and present than during ordinary consciousness.",
          "I was not aware of having/being a body but could feel that I was also part of the limitless space, filling it and expanding into it entirely.",
          "A kind of bright, open space... at some point there was a huge, brown Buddha statue with a multi-rowed pink pearl necklace, positive feelings appeared, happiness, joy, lightness and with that also again a feeling of my body, my existence.",
          "If serenity has a name, it was this relaxation.",
          "It was a moment of sudden realization.",
          "I did my normal work in the office, but at the same time I was a witness to my actions.",
          "I could not see any image of my body or my surroundings.",
          "I felt bliss, fully aware, relaxed, and full of energy.",

          "All thought stopped, and a great sense of mental clarity and a precious silence descended.",

          "The connected sensations that I remember clearly, pleasant.",
          "The daily confusion of thoughts has come to a complete rest.",
          "And instantly there was a sense of total awareness.",
          "It was largely emotionally neutral but peaceful.",
          "Bodily sensations were very clear, only completely different and not limited to the 'physical' body.",
          "I felt a 'turning inside out,' like passing through a needle's eye, everything dissolving: bodily sensations, thoughts, emotions.",
          "It felt like I was observing myself from within and looking at something completely free and selfless.",
          "I did not even worry whether one day this Peace would go away.",
          "I became the space, so to speak.",
          "The perception was crystal clear, the surroundings shimmered, and I became aware of the actual timelessness in the world.",
          "There was such profound peace and bliss.",
          "My body was very relaxed, my mind awake and without thoughts, emotionally I was moved and tears flowed.",

          "The impression of disappearing, of no longer being visible, came over me (it wouldn't have surprised me if someone had said so later).",
          "I experienced a vast, supportive stillness, infinite peace, and unconditional love.",
          "I was in an infinite, shapeless, colorless space.",
          "I travel through space, meeting different lifeforms, communicating directly and seeing their insides.",
          "Although it was dark, its extent was clearly three-dimensional, but at the same time I was aware that this space was a mental representation of my mind.",
          "It was a feeling of great vastness, non-thinking, vibrant happiness, and freedom.",
          "The strongest feelings were amazement and awe.",
          "In any case, I rested completely within myself.",
          "This also enhanced my intuition.",
          "The sense of living in a world that I experienced (this is still my default mode of being) fell completely away and instead there was only the experience itself.",
          "But this is not an ordinary pride, it is like a knowledge of inner strength in a confrontation that requires no action, but is free from any expectation and unfolds very spontaneously.",
          "A truly great experience.",
          "I could no longer distinguish between my body and the surroundings.",
          "Had a sense of (just) being aware, awake.",
          "I experienced profound stillness.",
          "Pure joy that was there without me having formulated the thought of this feeling.",
          "It had an absolutely hilarious quality to it also – the way I'd try to describe it is the realization that I'd spent all this time running around inside a tiny, compelling kaleidoscope looking for a doorway out, when in reality the kaleidoscope has no floor or ceiling.",
          "Suddenly everything feels still.",
          "During kinhin, I felt yesterday, today, and tomorrow merge, followed by being sucked into a tunnel of indescribable peace.",
          "After becoming aware of physical sensations, thoughts, and feelings, a deep feeling of joy, timelessness, and happiness arose.",
          "There was no longer really an inner center that observes, but just \"pure observation.\"",
          "I was very pleased about it.",
          "Letting go of my desire to react, the entire bodily experience fell away, producing an intense flame from bottom to top, with strong amazement and intensity, almost destabilizing.",
          "Initially frightening, it became cozy.",
          "My girlfriend and I were pumpkin picking; the weather and our mood were great.",
          "Now that I think a bit more about the experience, I have to say that I did in fact experience some kind of unity.",
          "The \"mental space\" began to expand and became steadily larger.",
          "In retrospect, it was a completely disembodied experience.",
          "This experience was surprising insofar as I had almost disassociated myself from my body (the main actor in the film) (\"That's not me at all!\").",
          "There was just now and here; my sense of self was the nebula.",
          "There were no more worries and fears.",
          "I refer to it now as the lucid void.",
          "At some point, I then had the feeling \"Now,\" having arrived in pure consciousness.",
          "It felt peaceful and true, yet I'm unsure how I felt.",
          "Everything was silent, and there was a lot of light.",
          "At the same time, I felt reverence and gratitude.",
          "Its good to be 'refreshed and released'.",
          "For a moment, there was only a space of experience/perception, in which I form the center (but not in a spatial sense) and which is the same when I sit at home.",
          "Sometimes a strong equanimity was also noticeable.",
          "The events around me were outside and at the same time somehow a part of me.",
          "Even the inner activity of my organs was perceptible with extreme intensity.",
          "Feelings of peace, happiness, and 'everything is okay as it is' arose within me.",
          "There was also an element of fear, because it feels quite groundless, and that is not something we intuitively like to experience.",
          "This I seemed to be bodyless and boundless.",
          "It took place about 4 yrs ago and I'm not sure what kind of languaging I have onboarded since then, but I do think that the awareness of the roominess had no center.",
          "My awareness spread in boundless directions.",
          "While listening to a wonderful lecture I felt completely settled.",
          "My thoughts became still and gave way to a state of clarity, peace, bliss.",
          "This feels like a revelation, but later, looking back, it also seems very obvious.",
          "The perception that all people around held their breath, were one with me and looked at me.",
          "In spring 2002, after bad news from a doctor, the world felt incredibly vibrant and beautiful, and I felt deeply connected with everything.",
          "Great happiness flowed through me.",
          "I no longer feel my body, I no longer hear anything from my surroundings, I no longer know where I begin and end and where I am.",
          "I think I also found my body as being very interesting.",
          "I felt warm, very present, connected with everything around me.",
          "A change occurred—lightness and freedom.",
          "It was simply indescribable.",
          "My five senses manifested one by one.",
          "But most of all, it invoked a strange sense of fearlessness, of intimacy with life and beyond.",
          "That morning there was a complete absence of fear, a state of complete freedom and all possibilities.",
          "As if the contrast were stronger than usual, as if the glasses had just been ultrasonically cleaned.",
          "It did not feel external to me, but rather like a state that I would be able to return to as the experience felt like it was drawn from me.",
          "I felt a deep sense of love - for myself, other people, plants and animals, and the universe.",
          "It was exhilarating and fulfilling, like being reborn in the dream, experiencing everything anew.",
          "This was so obvious, yet I'd never noticed before.",
          "In doing so, headaches disappeared and a deep inner peace spread.",
          "Life became drama-free.",
          "It was an experience of non-dual union that felt natural and extraordinary, yet it occurred within ordinary mind.",
          "I no longer felt my body.",
          "There was a feeling of contentment and calm, and yet tremendous energy, as if a channel had opened up in my mind.",
          "Time, space, and bodily boundaries dissolved, but I perceived my surroundings clearly.",
          "It felt like 'I' had an infinite amount of space.",
          "It's hard to describe, but I felt as much myself as my neighbor or anyone else.",
          "I felt an unusual calm and peace, and at that moment there was no desire even to maintain that state.",
          "These kinds of experiences are accompanied by a very intense feeling of joy.",
          "It was only a short moment - which left a longing behind ;).",
          "Everything becomes vast.",
          "I perceived everything around me very clearly, clearer than before.",
          "My body was as if dissolved, the boundaries were no longer perceptible, simultaneously boundless and grounded.",
          "The bodily sensations are as light as all other sensations (auditory and visual) and therefore a rather space-equal, expansive quality was perceived, in which the body is no longer at the center.",
          "It was a blessing which didn't last long and was not obvious to my friend, but which made an indelible impact on my awareness.",
          "I lost all sense of being the agent of action and perception, instead feeling myself as identical with these things.",
          "I had an extreme feeling of greatness and bliss.",
          "I also had the possibility of being within myself (looking at the events from my perspective) or stepping out of my body (looking at the events from a bird's-eye perspective).",
          "What was happening was enough; the mind had calmed down.",
          "Profound joy and equanimity that was not dependent upon thoughts.",
          "Deep peace and calm overcame me; I felt my body present, yet light and unburdened.",
          "It felt like returning to a forgotten but familiar natural state.",
          "I felt thoughts arising; I felt very peaceful, loving with them.",
          "In confronting a person, I could no longer distinguish whose eyes I was looking into, mine or the other person's.",
          "I felt like a lonely spectator in an empty cinema who suddenly realized that he is not the main actor in the film he is watching.",
          "Wakefulness was combined with clarity; everything was harmonious, just as it was.",
          "I only had the feeling that it was wonderful.",
          "Emotions were neutral but leaned towards a spectrum of positivity and inner contentment with peace.",
          "Several times as a very bright, weightless, vast state of complete stillness and vastness.",
          "This included 8 days of deprivation of sensory stimuli (hearing, seeing, touching, tasting only through the regular intake of a nutrient solution).",
          "A massive blue eye opened behind my eyes, changing colors as I moved through it.",
          "Then the same evening when I was listening to a lecture waves of bliss at every one of the words rippled through my entire being.",
          "It was also a feeling of recognition.",
          "Just welling from the body.",
          "It wasn't a sensation separate from a sound; it was consciousness—all of it.",
          "Since I knew this, it no longer confused me, and I could simply observe.",
          "At that moment, it felt to me as if it were the most essential thing I had ever experienced.",
          "There was spacelessness and weightlessness, lightness.",
          "I felt contentment without thoughts of the past or future, only the present.",
          "It was incredibly pleasant and pleasurable.",
          "There was a general sense of awe and joy.",
          "My mind felt vast, but not in a physical, out-of-body sense.",
          "I experienced great peace, a stillness, and was completely awake.",
          "There was also an equanimous joy - not coarse/rugged, but a subtle yet pervasive equanimity with positive intonations.",
          "When I focus on limitless space, my internal experience is peace, silence, nothing-totality.",
          "There was no uncanniness.",
          "I suddenly felt my tension in my body and had the insight: everything is as it is, quite natural.",
          "And so I feel again: the accesses and windows to my experience are open again.",
          "A feeling of ever-increasing depth arose, which intensified more and more, it became brighter and brighter.",
          "He described my experience perfectly.",
          "The feelings were mainly love and amazement and gratitude.",
          "My 'selfing' within the awareness was also wonderful.",
          "The sensations were of total peace and well-being; I felt happiness and at the same time astonishment at being feeling what I was feeling.",
          "At the same time, this space was aware of itself.",
          "I was on day 8 of a vipassana retreat meditating in the hall when suddenly the boundary of my body dissolved and I was everywhere at the same time.",
          "It was as if my gaze penetrated everything I looked at.",

          "It was easy, boundless and full of peace.",
          "At the same time, there was a feeling of unity of everything that was perceived as present (\"unity with the world\"); this is not surprising, as there was no longer any difference or contrast between subject and object, past, present and future.",

          "Floating in Cosmos must feel a bit like this.",
          "The state had a clear sense of deathlessness, and put living beings' constant struggle for survival in a whole different perspective.",
          "Every cough, every sniffle in the room, everything is totally accepted and my sense of self is gone, no feeling of space and time, and yet I am walking in a circle.",
          "A feeling of lightness, self-evidence and absolute bliss flooded me.",
          "Initially, I feared dissolving, but my body is now accustomed to it, knowing it will return to the 'normal' world.",
          "There was a quality of gentleness and wonder, not in any words or concepts, but more as a pervasive feeling of \"this is it, this is how everything truly is.\"",
          "I'm completely dissolved in myself, knowing all this.",
          "Though thoughts, feelings, and sensations arose, an increasing spaciousness emerged—ownerless and softly bright.",
          "The mood relaxed, positive and almost without desire.",
          "I was bliss.",
          "Another experience was falling into an empty space...",

          "I was as much a part of the space as the bed I was sitting on and the lamp visible from the window.",
          "I perceived everything in detail: the noises from the cars and the tram, the tingling of ants on my face, the lightness of my feet, the heaviness of the earth, my own thoughts – everything came together at once, everything fit perfectly – the inner and outer worlds had permeated each other.",
          "Eventually, a deep feeling of all that I can describe as extreme pleasure arose that seemed to flow through me.",
          "It became clear to me that these other points were souls or soul parts.",

          "I experienced a state of perfect stillness and boundlessness.",
          "It lasted for an hour or so, but I felt truly at peace with the world.",
          "I felt my body and it was all clear and simple and there, there were no more blockages, obstacles, ambiguities, everything was open and so simple.",
          "And since it was complete unity, I later asked myself which instance could even perceive this, because actually nobody was \"at home\".",
          "It was also very nice to simply have some peace and inner peace in my head.",
          "At the same time, I felt my body very intensely.",
          "In the experience of pure awareness, it felt as if I were simultaneously centered and very widely spread out.",
          "On the contrary - it was an intensive togetherness of everything.",
          "Everything felt fresh and alive, all embracing.",
          "Sounds were perfect and wonderful.",
          "It was beautiful, and for a little while, I didn't want it to end.",
          "The realization, connected with a feeling of happiness, that \"the whole world is within\" did not impair my daily life or my dealings with other people.",
          "From this state I returned with the awareness (now also visually) of being the whole universe, then a particle, and again feeling a body.",

          "My body felt nonexistent, then my mind 'expanded.'",
          "It was fantastic to experience the raw power of Mother Nature.",

          "Then I had a peak experience, feeling bliss at everyone knowing me deeply.",
          "At an emotional level there was a sense of great awe.",
          "This brought a peaceful, calm mood.",
          "The plants and I were totally unified.",
          "I felt a surge through my body and then an awareness encompassing my entire phenomenological experience.",
          "Expanding further to merge with the room.",
          "Instead, I take the rebellious boy into my arms, which leads to a feeling of deep self-connectedness and bliss.",
          "I saw some sort of galactic clusters while being suspended in darkness, but at the same time it felt as if my body was just everywhere; not scary at all, more like ecstatic, and, probably because there were no body sensations, I felt very relaxed.",
          "I was in a deep, black space without any boundaries.",
          "The mood during the experience was deep satisfaction and unshakeable serenity.",
          "Days later, psychological thoughts ceased, only practical ones remained.",

          "During this time, I perceived myself as completely detached from my thoughts and feelings.",
          "Everything is incredibly clear.",
          "I felt aware, it felt like whatever thoughts I had seemed like they flew through a stream in an open environment, without any restrictions.",
          "After this transition, I was in the center of an unfathomably boundless space that examined me from countless waking eyes – an unspeakably naked state.",
          "The great advantage was that I didn't get tired at all.",
          "I had many moments of solitude, infused with deep knowledge and wisdom.",
          "There was no inner dialogue, the predominant emotion was equanimity and great happiness.",
          "I was still in my room, but I no longer knew whether I was the whole room or just a fraction.",
          "For me, this space was an object of my consciousness, in which the objects of my sensory perception are placed.",
          "It was peaceful, free and flowing.",
          "I knew, if anything disturbed this Peace, it was my own reaction, which I could stop immediately by reverting to Stillness, so, how could it go?",

          "I could see the people in the room, although I had known them for a long time, I saw them for the first time.",
          "I perceived the people around me exactly, heard what they were saying, but I was so much more, full of this experience of more than this room we were in...I was told that I had a detached smile.",
          "Since then, I've felt deep trust and no longer fear.",
          "The feeling as if the mantra fell \"through me\" occurred.",
          "The experience was relieving, like taking off a tight shoe.",
          "The clearest feeling was rather that perhaps it acted and I watched.",
          "It was pure joy without attachment.",
          "My body boundaries almost completely dissolved and an infinite, bright space became experienceable.",
          "but I basked in it and enjoyed it.",
          "This also resulted in a distinct feeling of sublimity and that I can create my own reality and observe myself and my \"avatar,\" so to speak, simultaneously from the outside.",
          "The air was clear, the sun setting.",
          "It was connected with a feeling of fullness, or wholeness, or perhaps emptiness - I wouldn't know how to tell them apart in the situation - very blissful.",
          "During a meditation, I fell into a very vast, open, dark space that felt boundless and very, very still.",
          "As my mind opened, so did the world.",
          "I experienced awareness itself.",
          "Tactile and bodily sensations had a weightlessness or transparency, unlimited.",
          "When I opened my eyes, it was as if a film/a coloration consisting of concepts, thoughts, and evaluations had been removed from the outside world.",
          "It was a very pleasant experience.",
          "There was total equanimity, and it was perfect; there was no need to \"come back\".",
          "It was as if my body/my being was pixilated and dissolved into the rest of the pixels that make up the entirety of everything else.",
          "It also took away my fear of death, since I have been convinced ever since that this consciousness continues beyond death, that it is indestructible.",
          "As the thought of having such \"Space\", itself seems to have been coming from the same \"Space\", and the realization of it being reflective comes from the same place too.",
          "Then, calm returned, with strong identification with the space/ground of the experience.",
          "The willpower was extreme, uncompromising, violent, honest – never again false ideas/illusions.",
          "I was not just the sounds I could hear, but the awareness of sound traveling from a body all the way to the corner of the room, and all the places in between.",
          "The emerging space is reaction-free, like a pause.",
          "This laughter was so refreshing, so natural, that I fell in love with it.",
          "I was at peace and connected and in agreement with everything that could have happened.",
          "There was no thinking at the time, just total ease and tranquility that had occurred really quite a few days into the retreat.",
          "It was part amazement and excitement, and part recognition that I'd set off from where I had just been that drove the awareness.",
          "I became the observer again, the center of my experience, aware of awareness but not awareness itself.",
          "It feels as if something has broken open, of which I no longer know where \"it is still breaking through\"... beyond everything that has been experienced so far.",
          "And a subtle feeling (no thought) of this is right.",
          "- And before I knew it, my heart leaped and I bathed in a sea of equanimity and boundless love.",
          "At that moment, I felt a deep sense of unity and oneness.",
          "Suddenly, everything went quiet.",
          "Something opened up inside me and everything was good - on a deep level everything was connected, there was no longer an I, but only an emptiness (a space) in which there was joy, peace, stillness, fullness and depth.",
          "It was the most effortless and 'simple' way of being, and there was a strong experience of being a crystal-clear vessel, fully capable of being of service for whatever might be needed at that time and place.",
          "I was in a state of total awareness, part of an infinite ocean of light.",
          "Second, I was able to access a mental space I called 'the silence' where insights flow freely, and I'm completely relaxed.",
          "In any case, it felt like an inner fall, a plunge from a great height.",
          "It was an experience affecting directly all senses and the mind at the same time, with enormous force.",
          "It was exhilarating; I was keenly aware of a self separate from my body and thoughts.",
          "It entailed a heightened sense of unity, of being a part of all that was in the moment.",
          "I had this sense of awe, energetic radiance, sense of connectedness with everything, no good, no bad, no self, no time – just witness and in awe of the miracle of my own consciousness – like seeing the sun for the first time.",
          "Surprisingly, I felt my skeleton, my bone structure and details of my internal body that I had never perceived before, it was surprising: like everything else around me, everything seemed new to me every second, with wonder.",
          "The knot was resolved immediately, and the suffering inside me related to her unintelligible loss stopped, not just then but forever; I finally found myself accepting, forgiving, letting go.",
          "I experienced a vast, boundless space, a unity of all.",
          "I had no perception of my body.",
          "I was in an inner space that resembled a cathedral.",
          "A non-physical space emerged within me, which increased moment by moment and in which the boundaries between the perceiver and the perceived object blurred.",
          "It didn't really map on to any previous experiences I'd had so I couldn't really call it joy or pleasure or happiness in the traditional sense.",
          "As a result, my fears, worries and other important things simply became unimportant.",
          "There was a lot of clarity (consciousness cognizing itself) and a joy that lasted for several days.",
          "Although I haven't experienced this absolute bliss, I am at peace with it.",
          "Unlike typical out-of-body experiences, I had no visual external perspective.",
          "It was, however, undeniably positive, both light (unburdened) and wondrous at the same time.",
          "It felt like I was standing a few meters away from an energetic representation of myself.",
          "We were in warrior 2, and the teacher guided us to notice sensation, absent quality or commentary.",
          "There was just this knowing of sensations coming and going, no good or bad, just watching these sensations do their thing.",
          "The eyes opened.",
          "It was as if I became detached from myself, but not bodily or emotionally.",
          "It was absolute peace, without this experience triggering any feeling, but that too was beyond any humanly known feeling.",
          "I have answered the questions above having in mind a specific experience I had during a meditation some years ago: Everything was this perception of an endless space, like between planets, without light, but somehow bright, without anything in it, a complete nothing, but at the same time with all the potentialities in it!",
          "A feeling of unity, depth, and bliss arose, and above all, of freedom, infinite freedom.",
          "Attention floated freely in space between the different mind objects.",
          "Main feeling I had was just of seeing everything as it truly is.",
          "The sensation of conscious space was also amazing.",
          "I've experienced both unity and periods of many thoughts.",
          "It also feels as if an inner split, a wound, is growing together a little.",
          "I had the feeling that I no longer existed as a person.",
          "I felt a calm abiding compassion and my desire for anything was a faint bubbling that would drop away only to arise upon a jostling or another such movement.",
          "I was not anxious or afraid; my worldly worries seemed insignificant.",
          "It was an experience of complete acceptance of whatever was happening.",
          "A complete marvel at the perfection and beauty of God's creation infused my heart.",
          "There was a clear sense of being centered but the center as quite empty, like an electron with no mass.",
          "The interconnectedness was more significant than individual elements, which faded into a higher synthesis, losing their independence...",
          "It was an experience of great connectedness with everything, an experience of unity with nature, with everything.",
          "Suddenly a strong feeling of insight came over me.",
          "This was a very positive experience.",
          "- The space opened up by itself and revealed itself to me.",
          "The concept of passing time was absent and the experience was definitely positive.",
          "I felt as if something had turned \"inside out\", as if nothing in my perceptual fields was as usual.",
          "My heart became warm and full.",
          "I felt awake like never before, precisely as if I were seeing things for the first time.",
          "Suddenly I felt completely one (united) with my participants.",
          "It felt like boundless loving-kindness in eternity, and I was part of that love.",
          "The experience went from the beautiful harmonious surroundings to a deep experience of bliss that is endless.",
          "It was an indescribable feeling of oneness.",
          "It was as if everything was expanding, and the sensations were incredibly pleasant; I felt a great deal of lightness, harmony, and fullness.",
          "I believe that the experience was infused with a sense of calmness, but I think describing it in any valenced terms (i.e., positive or negative) would be inappropriate.",
          "I also had the feeling of seeing the objects as if for the first time, with a renewed attention similar to that of children who look at things for the first time.",
          "It was immensely relieving and giddy.",
          "In the center stood the self-resting recognition!!",
          "As described, I felt connection, awe, and oneness.",
          "- My mind rocked like a nutshell on the high seas in the highest waves.",
          "Astonishing and joyful in the first moment, but at the same time very simple.",
          "Connected with this was also a strong feeling of fearlessness.",
          "Instead, a perception of a space emerged, which perhaps extended slightly beyond my body, but was still clearly defined.",
          "As if I could feel every little part of my body.",
          "I could run the \"Goenka-buzz\" smoothly through my body and extend it beyond its boundaries.",
          "It's the best experience I've ever had.",
          "It was even somewhat like I felt myself moving forward in this space, like a spaceship in space.",
          "It was a feeling of boundlessness and deep peace.",
          "I also knew that I am also something \"bigger, from outside and above,\" watching myself how I am dreaming.",
          "It was outside of me because I saw it through my eyes, but it felt completely different than usual.",
          "I am reassured and relieved.",
          "I am completely rested and fresh.",
          "Suddenly I was in a state of absolute stillness and peace that I had never experienced before.",
          "The numbness of everyday life is gone, things feel fresh.",
          "Afterwards, I felt very relaxed.",
          "I felt as if I and my room with all the objects inside were a single space, i.e.",
          "As soon as I sat in the car, my surroundings completely dissolved.",
          "Sensations were heightened.",
          "I don't think I've ever been here before, but now, there are no distractions from the present moment.",
          "However, this made me aware that I had a 'center' or 'essence' with this large, limitless body around it.",
          "Looking into my eyes felt like looking at a chess piece—no subject or object, just what appeared.",
          "There are few words to describe the experience itself, but the summary would be two words: absolute understanding.",
          "It was an overriding sense of unity.",
          "Except that my whole world was completely turned inside out, it was, so to speak, still totally normal...",
          "Apart from deep peace, there was nothing particularly euphoric or newsworthy about it.",
          "I realized, knew beyond doubt, that what I was experiencing was the grace of direct knowledge of the essence of things, and I realized how blind I had been, how I had been looking the wrong way, overlooking the most obvious, not seeing what was directly in front of me, waiting to be discovered, so obvious, but I had always overlooked it.",
          "I identify this space with pure consciousness.",
          "Each thought or sound helps this \"space\" getting highlighted, as this appears to be the center (in a non-physical way), of everything... of every thought that appears, or sound from the surrounding appears in this space.",
          "Resting there, there was a sense of profound quiet.",
          "However, there was a sense of unity of all things, beings, and life, and a sense of love interwoven into the space, connecting everything.",
          "In contrast to 1, here I was happy, more emotional in the perception of the delta from the previous storms of thought to a \"non-feeling.\"",
          "I had a feeling of boundless space.",
          "I didn't feel a contracted version of a self, but rather an openness, boundless space.",
          "From this point on, I could no longer physically perceive my body, even though I tried to focus my attention on individual body regions or fingers.",
          "As I went through my body with my attention from top to bottom, I perceived my whole body as a tingling, vibrating something.",
          "It was a state of pure being, not particularly happy, definitely not unhappy either - that is a question that did not arise at the moment.",
          "Another experience particularly affected my heart; it was very active, very open, very touchable, very awake, and I was amazed that such a state even exists.",
          "The sense of a body had dissolved, there was just experience happening.",
          "It was a very pleasant experience.",
          "The evening meditation bell rang at 5:00 PM—my meal untouched.",
          "In any case, since then I can easily and almost at any time enter this delicious silence.",
          "I also felt like the universe loved me and that I was completely safe.",
          "I am content.",
          "This took a little while, then I somehow let go of my control, and dissolved, as I felt it.",
          "In these moments, I became aware that my body was moving while 'I' could observe and perceive it and everything else.",
          "I perceived the noises around me, but at the same time I was completely centered and within myself.",
          "Then came the physical sensation of 'shrinking', as if my coat suddenly became too big and I was shrinking smaller and smaller into it.",
          "Everything felt silent, crisp, beautiful.",
          "What I remember most, even now physically, is the feeling of indivisibility, there was no me and everything else, everything was one.",
          "I moved/flew or rather diffused through the vacuum between them.",
          "It was fearless and liberating and left behind something like a feeling of \"this is immortal.\"",
          "What then happened with, in me or around me was completely beyond my control.",
          "It felt like \"oneness,\" but without the usual feelings like love or bliss.",
          "Then awareness turned to look inwards and there was no longer a division between \"self\" and \"space.\"",
          "It was a wonderful atmosphere.",
          "To this was associated an inner sense of energy, and a sense of liberation, of relief.",
          "For the space itself began to move, over me in two opposite circular movements, somewhat like if one takes a jar of marmalade, whose screw cap does not open, horizontally on one's lap, in order to screw it on with great effort with both hands.",
          "Sounds and colors rushed in.",
          "The experience was overwhelming and natural at the same time.",
          "This insight settled deeply, replacing the anxious seeking that drove me.",
          "Rather neutral and curious, no longer so identified as before.",
          "Wherever my attention went, objects would form—like a car, but encompassing every make, model, and color, each shifting and flowing.",
          "There was breath, visual information, acoustic information, the coldness of the floor.",
          "The same was true for fear.",
          "I hardly perceive my body anymore.",
          "I had no strong emotions, only a feeling of deep peace, clarity and serenity.",
          "That is, all mental phenomena, including sensations, thoughts, emotions, memories, pre-linguistic murmurings, and even awareness itself, became clear AS mental phenomenon, essentially no different from each other, even though each was, if anything, MORE distinguishable from its neighbours than usual.",
          "Suddenly, I saw the question 'why?'",
          "I began to discorporate and spread in every direction.",
          "I had the feeling of floating in complete contentment.",
          "There is something \"equanimous\", that is to say that if a positive emotion or joy appears it is in fact after the experience of pure consciousness - once a feeling takes a certain strength, a thought takes place, or a sensation; it is the return to awakened but more traditional consciousness.",
          "I was this space and this space was pure awareness.",
          "I was just closing my eyes and it sounds odd, but there really is not any other word in the English language that describes the experience except the sound of the word bliss.",
          "I don't remember much how I felt about my body or sense of self.",
          "I felt gratitude, awareness.",
          "I don't know how to explain that I felt like myself (whatever that is) while also feeling like a camera observing myself.",
          "I felt like I just 'was' and my awareness just observed.",
          "Emotionally pleasant, but not euphoric, rather amazed, \"wow!",
          "As if I completely dissolved, all physical boundaries blurred; no separation between inside and outside.",
          "I felt incredible vastness, as if connected to another sphere.",
          "There was heightened alertness and full awareness.",
          "The feeling of clarity and tranquility was immense.",
          "I was in a space that wasn't me.",
          "Right afterwards I took a walk and to my left there was an incredibly beautiful sunset and to my right at the same time a rainbow and then I knew Nature was telling me the decision was correct.",
          "I was perfectly calm, unaware if my eyes were open or closed.",
          "My being was whole like perhaps it had never been and this was the greatest joy imaginable.",
          "There was also visual and auditory clarity that accompanied it.",
          "Thoughts, sensations and emotions were present but felt fluid and seemed to emanate from my self which simultaneously felt at one with all that was.",
          "It was what I would call the bliss of non-duality.",
          "Everything was clearer and more distinct.",
          "The sense of hearing returned first, with the perception of the singing bowl.",
          "Then I passed a barrier, re-entering my body.",
          "The overwhelming feeling of the present moment's completeness pervaded the experience.",
          "After my thoughts had drifted away, I felt an optically and acoustically empty, boundless space far removed from any sense of time and with regularly flowing vibrations \"through me\".",
          "It was like a trance, almost ecstatic, incredibly beautiful.",
          "This unexpected, effortless feeling lasted only a short time but was profoundly impactful, proving the reality of the oneness of all beings.",
          "It was more like a strong feeling of intimacy with oneself.",
          "It was as if I were looking the sky \"in the eyes\" and for the first time I realized how immense it was, how impossible it was for me to look at it all.",
          "All complications are gone during those moments.",
          "I felt deeply one with the world and everything in it.",
          "The experiences have been profound: clear, harmonious, perfect, filled with unconditional love for myself and the world, and oneness with everything.",
          "In the bathroom, holding a seriously ill friend, I felt boundless oneness, no time or space, just peaceful oneness including the here and now.",
          "Soon the emotion came, tears of joy flowing.",
          "Then an infinite space opened up and I practically no longer existed.",
          "There were no fears, only a little happiness, a smiling feeling it was ok and would be ok in the future.",
          "However, the body or space appears within it—completely relaxed.",
          "I was aware I knew it, but I felt fascinated by how it was, the colors, the objects, the fact that it existed and that I was there.",
          "My companion also noticed it and asked me what was going on.",
          "And that the 'me' that was watching me was also of pure energetic composition.",
          "It was as though I was absorbed by the world which I had been focusing on so intently that I ceased to observe objects anymore but instead was at one with the environment as a whole.",
          "The empty space shifted into a unified presence.",
          "My body was there, fine, flowing.",
          "The numbers gradually disappeared and the space expanded.",
          "My body awareness was very intense.",
          "I've had similar experiences, but this one was the most beautiful.",
          "It was fulfilling!",
          "In fact, they seemed to mutually fuel each other; as the light became stronger, awareness increased, and vice versa.",
          "It was a stable, peaceful experience.",
          "I almost cry with joy when I think about it.",
          "My consciousness delighted in the energy of pure being; the entire kinhin line became one being with many legs.",
          "There was a great calm and concentration with self-awareness in the present moment and a soft letting go of EVERYTHING (thoughts, ideas, feelings, etc...).",
          "The sky was everywhere, and this perception changed the perception of all the other objects in the scene, as if they were inside something gigantic.",
          "This was more than the usual Sati, it sounded like a master with personal instructions.",
          "There was a unity of consciousness I'd never experienced; the lines between sensations, sights, sounds, emotions, and thoughts blurred into oneness.",
          "Not burdened by the heat of the usual stories.",
          "There was no time, I had no body, yet I had a presence that distinguished me from the white, yet I also was part of the white space.",
          "I had the feeling of being exactly where life wanted me to be.",
          "I was very equanimous.",
          "It felt peaceful and alert.",
          "Physical arousal remained, but fear vanished.",
          "This entire scene felt like it played itself out inside my consciousness, not in any physical space that I could touch in this reality.",
          "The temperature was comfortable and it was quiet, except for some occasional wind.",
          "There was a joyful surprise every time a nearby object moved in relation to an object that was far away, even though this was constantly happening.",
          "I opened my eyes and saw the sky, the grass, my friend – I had the feeling that someone had cleaned my old glasses: it radiated through everything, even through the dust.",
          "Then, a larger undulation of the vastness itself joined it.",
          "Then, awareness became the center and periphery.",
          "I opened my eyes and all the objects in the room were present as usual, but I saw them with a kind of transcendent clarity.",
          "I felt completely at peace.",
          "I walked completely calmly towards the rushing cow—and it was so incredible—the cow simply stopped galloping in front of me, and I could simply touch and hold it—and there was this encounter, this feeling of not being separate from this cow; it looked at me so incredulously and was completely trusting—we were both in a totally different space, a different time, a different connection, and my body was sleepwalking but completely autonomous; it was a completely fearless, very peaceful situation—absolutely in this outer world and completely not of this world—everything was as if dampened by something soft, tender, light, as if packed in cotton wool—yes, perhaps the space really had a different density.",
          "There was a visual centre to the experience, but only because that's where light met the eyes.",
          "There was also the quality of wonder, awe, and simultaneously simplicity, of being invited to play.",
          "I simply felt happy, whole, safe, one with God.",
          "I wasn't noticing something, but it was pure noticing; I wasn't questioning something, but it was pure questioning.",
          "If ever a thought or feeling arose, it was immediately surrendered back to where it came from.",
          "Visually, I don't remember seeing anyone or anything, but I was suddenly in a universe where communication was instantaneous and unobstructed between people.",
          "It also gave me some clues on how to 'stumble' upon it."

          "Deep silence filled with brightness, a feeling of oneness with everything, part of the whole, blurring of the boundaries between body and environment, but with clear body boundaries, so no out-of-body experiences (only in the first year of meditation practice), lifting of the startle reflex, but internally the most precise perception of the \"nerve pathway of fright\", i.e., completely undisturbed still sitting with a sudden bang and detailed perception of eardrum excitation to the heart.",

          "One could describe the state as transcendence.",
          "Weightless, still, indescribably bright and peaceful, all boundaries are lifted, my body boundaries are merged with the surroundings, the universe, I am the sky, the sky is all there is, I am no more, I have dissolved (but it is not effortless to reach this state; 'on a smaller scale', this also works when seeing colors, hearing sounds, smelling flowers, feeling the wind... basically, it is the form of being of pure happiness - I wish it to all beings)",
          "Something like \"Is-ness\" - an equally strong, powerful, yet gentle and touching power of experience.",
          "A knowing of another nature that preceded everything else.",
          "Rest and detachment with a simultaneous feeling of connectedness and being completely present with myself.",
          "Though complete, paradoxically, there's a sense of someone noticing the qualities or enjoyment, a residue of beholding it rather than looking entirely from it.",
          "Our presence without concept without effort, unlimited space and luminosity clarity, no more body, no more limits, no more self, only this luminosity, this infinite space, this joy without fear, like a natural state.",
          "Alone, it is an experience of fullness, absolutes, where opposites unite (everything and nothing), where time seems to stop.",
          "But it is a state that feels like \"before something\", perhaps like before a complete dissolution.",
          "Dissolution of body feeling, feeling of floating above the body, weightlessness - stillness, oneness - being, everything is okay as it is, boundaries blur - lucid dreams, knowing in the dream that it's a dream and solving tasks set the night before in the dream - lucid dreams, 'waking up' in the dream, knowing that it's a dream and then shaping the dream - being able to calm thoughts, turning to breathing/body, sense of time blurs - sudden knowledge 'everything makes sense and how life works' the recognition triggers 'divine' laughter (and unfortunately this 'knowledge' soon disappears again :( ) - feeling of being connected with everything and everyone, generates feelings of love, peace and joy - experiencing emptiness that is not empty",
          "Strong self-knowledge, absence of fear, a feeling that the 'I' would remain unharmed, regardless of experience.",
          "The experience ends with the end of the session, in a recitation (chanting), which fills the vessel of my experience with a pure feeling of happiness.",

          "Absolute unbroken peace.",
          "Deep silence, the feeling of simply being pure being, completely beyond any individuality.",
          "The Italian gold gets: A state, in a retreat, in a \"pause\", outside, where I suddenly felt connected to everything, with above, the clouds or the sky - I perceived something like threads between me and the universe.",
          "It is like another level of existence.",
          "An omnipresent eternal NOW consciousness, which splits into myriads of entities to create a reality of duality.",
          "I maximize relaxation and vulnerability to the present, feeling joy, love, or simply being.",
          "A sense of 'selflessness' is also achieved.",
          "I would describe it better as a more immediate contact than usual with the world (i.e., less mediated in terms of conceptual processing), with less \"temporal delay,\" more \"inclusive\" (a feeling of expansion of peripersonal space to the point of blurring the distinction between self/non-self, but more like a loss of importance of the self), and above all with a physical-mental feeling of vibrant presence more than usual.",
          "While I search for words to describe this, I am back in that room – in that moment.",
          "A state of endlessness but with the knowledge that one can leave it at any time.",
          "Boundless expanse, deep silence, peace, feeling the breath of the world and oneness with it, deep joy; then a onset of thinking – too much of this greatness.",
          "The state is felt in the head: similar to just before falling asleep, a pleasant wavering of head content completely without thoughts, feelings, or sensations.",
          "After many stormy weeks, my soul longs for peace in 1980: After many strenuous and exciting therapeutic groups, emotional dramas and tantric phases of happiness, the time comes for me, quite spontaneously, where I only want to enjoy the quiet sitting.",
          "Feeling of oneness.",
          "And a very pleasant sensation of gratitude and lightness.",
          "During my Deep Field Relaxation™ sessions, I experience the deep feeling of oneness with all that is.",
          "And then of course waves of bliss at every move of nature, its wind, clouds, plants etc.",
          "A feeling of merging with all happiness and love.",
          "The feeling of not being separate.",
          "How should it be named if one wants to commit a kind of psychic suicide in the sense of a boundary-crossing contraction of the will with the aim of getting rid of one's self, of \"getting even\"?",
          "A state free of fear and other negative feelings.",
          "Pure relaxation, happiness."

          "Another more general experience over time is that my sleep is lighter and I remember my dreams and can control them.",

          "Full wakefulness is there, dullness is absent.",

          "During a nightmare, I stepped out of the events with the realization that all these images and stories are a product of my thinking - and I experienced an immediate stillness, freedom, wakefulness, and clarity that went very deep.",
          "I had some experiences during transitions into lucid dreams.",
          "I realized that the dream must be a dream because I found an inconsistency in the depiction of the space in which I found myself.",
          "I went through all stages of falling asleep to a dreamless state of nothingness with full consciousness and was allowed to realize that consciousness is constantly present, even if one can no longer remember it later.",
          "Instead, I was still alive, but I was not as my body — I was a presence in the room, being aware of that space, with all light entering the room (the dream was happening during the day, but there was just daylight).",

          "Both times at some point of the fall, seemed not too long from when it started, I saw some dark figures behind the walls and sort of flew back up and into my body and woke up with a scream.",
          "The experience of freedom of action, e.g., flying or being able to save oneself from danger, is also a pleasure but not rapture; not a transcendent state of consciousness, but everyday consciousness in dream reality, to which otherwise the more primitive dream consciousness would belong.",
          "Brightness, despite an eye mask, in dream sleep: jaguar, boa, eagle, horse, Horus, gates of light, energy perception in the body, rising upwards, tingling, pulsing, knocking, circling, it feels like electricity is flowing.",

          "The experience I documented above occurred when transitioning from sleep to waking.",
          "Recognizing this effortless state again and again, we gradually become re-awakened.",

          "It occurred in the waking state.",
          "Once I woke up completely refreshed but was so clear and even the body so rested as if I had not slept at all, because there was no stiffness or dullness whatsoever neither in my body nor in my mind.",
          "I am then completely awake, very present, and at the same time I get the impression that something in me is observing me and at the same time is one with me and sometimes also with my surroundings.",
          "Another experience refers to a lucid dream during which, in a pursuit, I realized that I was dreaming and then consciously confronted the scenario and decided to jump from a 10-meter-high tree knowing that nothing would happen to me and that I could change everything around me as I now \"want\" or imagine.",
          "I often think about this dream and this feeling of a kind of liberation and it compares itself automatically with what I experience in meditation.",

          "the experience of restful wakefulness is simultaneously present.",
          "The moment of switching then occurs spontaneously, sometimes immediately when closing one's eyes, sometimes not at all; in any case, with increasing practice more regularly and under good conditions intentionally triggerable.",
          "In my dream, I was frantically trying to turn on a light switch when I heard the chime.",
          "1) In waking, PA is always present, permeating all mental, emotional, and physical activity—a complete fusion.",
          "At first I am overwhelmed, because it is broad daylight and I myself am completely awake with everything around me.",
          "Then I realized that my body was asleep.",
          "I'm on my phone, so I'll keep it short ;) – I recognize the dream, suddenly I'm totally present, the dream environment gets a completely different quality, seems hyperrealistic and alive.",
          "etc., the dream begins.",
          "I glide into a state that I cannot classify as sleep or wakefulness: I feel my whole body very intensely and in its entirety, manifold bodily sensations.",
          "In waking sleep, the body lies as if asleep, while the mind is awake, calm and content.",
          "I feel neither tired nor wide awake, but relaxedly awake.",
          "I slept but was awake.",
          "I could remember everything that had happened before in the dream, the dissolving etc.",
          "In dream sleep: I experience images, situations in which I am wonderfully free/liberated from everyday life and in intimate connection with my surroundings, the world.",
          "The idea that a thought-free dream state could be achieved.",
          "and not characterized by hyper-awareness, but rather had a dream-like quality.",
          "In the 'falling asleep phase', there was suddenly an awareness of total boundlessness.",
          "I became aware that while I was sleeping and dreaming, I was completely awake at the same time.",
          "In experiences in the non-dreaming state, I often had the perception as if an observer, but not a physically contoured observer, but rather \"the observing\" is simply taking note with participation of what is currently appearing in the area that I otherwise call \"in me\" or also \"I\", all thoughts, feelings, emotions, etc., that I could then switch again to a more controlling active observer, who could specifically direct certain ideas and focusings considered helpful by this instance.",
          "2. in a longer phase with little sleep, which resembled a dream state.",
          "2) In dreams, I'm fully awake and autonomous, doing what I want.",

          "For me, pure awareness is flow.",
          "For me, experiencing pure awareness is an experience that occurs both in meditation and in everyday life, has much to do with the direction of my focus and is like a shining through of reality when all ideas, concepts... step aside for a moment.",
          "There is not even perception anymore.",

          "It is also possible that sensory perceptions are included in the horizon of attention.",
          "Because if I am 100% in pure awareness, i.e.",

          "In a way, there is then no longer a focus, since perception itself is felt.",
          "The senses of hearing and feeling are often very active in me; I perceive things in my closer surroundings as if I were standing next to them.",
          "• Awareness of awareness in vastness, stillness, peace • Awareness with later-arriving visions",
          "On the other hand, there are paradoxical states of consciousness: a vast emptiness and yet a vibrant fullness, a presence of Being that opens up deepest serenity and simultaneously overwhelming ecstasy and bliss.",
          "Therefore, one does not even have to be aware that one is in the state of pure awareness.",
          "But what I can do is to train my perception in such a way that I stand exactly on this narrow line and perceive awareness to the greatest extent possible.",
          "I write 'I am of the opinion' and not 'I can maintain pure awareness', because we always stay in the conceptual and talk about something that is rather beyond the conceptual.",
          "This awareness is always there, behind thinking and sensing.",
          "When a thought arises from pure awareness, it is allowed (not forced) to dissolve back into pure awareness.",
          "And in my opinion, it is only then possible to distinguish between subjective and objective perception.",

          "Awareness settles and expands to infinity.",
          "Awareness then appears when I don't expect it in any way - I experience it as a spontaneous state, which I also encounter when staying in nature.",
          "I remain completely concentrated on this perception, believe I clearly recognize how the field of awareness is aware of its own weakness.",
          "It's difficult to describe awareness without content or object; it's like sight without vision, a simple acknowledgment of what is, pure awakeness, the fundamental feeling of consciousness being 'on,' the constant underlying all experience.",
          "As if awareness is the only thing that exists, but I am that awareness and not separate from it.",
          "It gives me the liberating and ridiculous or humorous realization: If I did not exist as an organism, I would not be aware of awareness - and that too is completely irrelevant and unimportant in this moment.",
          "There's a clear divide between accessing pure awareness through the heart and mind.",
          "It's difficult to describe the state of pure awareness.",
          "I rest in this awareness and am one with it.",
          "Awareness itself was always already aware.",
          "This can only come through a process involving much working through (which transitions/gradates to playing out of) what I normally 'know' to be the impossible reconciliation of all the information in my mind (of course it is not all logically consistent, as no-one's knowledge/memories are) including meta-level knowledge about consciousness theories (which is why I think the request to describe things 'not according to any theory' is absurd) and the impossibility of non-theory-laden descriptions.",
          "Only short, but clearly perceptible.",
          "What remains is the fact of experiencing (being aware of) something that is not there.",
          "Awareness is simply aware *as* them, not *of* them.",
          "Describing the Big Awareness Event is pointless; it's always there, bigger than words.",
          "The same with hearing or thinking.",
          "The only way I can assert an experience of pure awareness is by looking back on the session, at which point an observer is fabricated.",
          "Whether or not this is considered an experience of pure awareness, I'm not positive.",
          "The attempt to formulate the content of awareness disenchants it again.",
          "My experience with pure awareness often appears in groups.",
          "One does not automatically always enter this difficult-to-describe 'field of overarching being', but it requires a certain letting go of everyday and personal circumstances, it is also not necessarily predictable or directly to be initiated that the 'pure awareness' should happen exactly at this moment, on the contrary, focusing on it is rather counterproductive, in my experience.",
          "I don't know if that is \"awareness\" in your sense.",
          "I can experience pure clarity through the awareness of the presence of Being, without visual perception.",
          "Awareness had space for everything, while not 'being' any single thing.",
          "What's most characteristic about it is that awareness is a quality as such in the field of experience.",
          "Pure awareness, for me, is an all-pervasive state where the boundary between myself and the surrounding reality merges, while both my body and reality remain clear.",
          "Pure awareness, yes, but fuller than that – a brightness unrelated to color/light is another good expression!",
          "It becomes obvious and without doubt \"feel-\" and recognizable that awareness is constantly and exclusively aware of itself and that a previous feeling conditioned by acquired beliefs (I as a person WITH awareness am constantly aware of a new object in a sequence) is factually wrong.",
          "I define awareness as fully conscious, regardless of whether one thinks - or not.",
          "The main and almost exclusive contents of consciousness were light and awareness.",
          "Awareness is very widespread, beyond the boundaries of the body or space.",
          "I only perceive what is.",
          "I've had a few pure awareness experiences and it's also hard for me to segment and 'focus on one'; they all sort of blur together.",
          "For me, the state of pure awareness is an envelopment.",
          "The \"consciousness of pure awareness\" does not occur frequently, and I have the impression that I cannot ultimately \"control\" it.",
          "In the true state of true pure awareness, objective observation is first possible.",
          "Who in me experiences perception?",
          "In pure awareness, I always experience a lightness.",
          "At an earlier moment, more in the context of shamatha, 'awareness of awareness' practice has sensitised, opened up... With this practice: very much on the forefront the clarity and the knowingness of this indestructible awareness, with my 'getting out of the way'.",
          "For me, pure awareness is a calm, impersonal, blissful presence.",
          "There are no distractions, because everything I'm aware of is awareness itself.",
          "My experience with what I consider to be experiences of pure awareness were moments of intense clarity – on the one hand, moments of the impression of being able to overlook everything and the experience of infinite abundance – not a vacuum – or a kind of emptiness that, however, admitted everything, i.e., again infinite abundance (not empty emptiness).",
          "Awareness without end - clear and vast and at the same time everything within it, from it.",
          "If I focus particularly on awareness itself, it begins to pervade all experience.",
          "That cannot be known by the mind.",
          "In this way the sense of pure-awareness, or the fundamentalness of awareness as the ground of all perception, stays present, while thought and action and activity can still be engaged in, while being felt as unfolding naturally, effortlessly, informed by the wisdom-clarity-freeness of the awareness that underpins everything.",
          "What you have defined as 'pure awareness', I would describe as follows: being aware that some (any) content of experience appears (even very subtle, like the fact of breathing or just being alive), and then becoming aware that what appears is the non-appearing of something that does not appear.",
          "I'm left in pure awareness.",
          "As already mentioned, suitable words are lacking for subtle experiential worlds, because these have fixed meaning patterns, and in 'pure awareness' nothing is clearly defined anymore and it does not follow any standardized pattern...",
          "Pure awareness is: dissolution in space and time, highest alertness in absolute inner stillness and immobility, boundless perception of other human beings, dying and rebirth in one moment.",
          "This 'self-knowing' awareness is now present in the background or in the foreground of all waking experiencing, akin to the way space is present all the time even when not attended to.",
          "Not at the center of the experience of hearing or thinking, but aware of those things (and maybe all things?)",
          "Pure awareness, clarity of the mind is empty in the sense of being empty of any physical form, etc.",
          "Pure awareness is spontaneous, without content, if content is 'something', and yet 'content' is there, if content does not mean 'nothing'; pure awareness exists from itself, seems and has no observer, since there is no place of retreat, everything is there, clear, absence of aggression.",
          "There is only awareness that I am.",
          "Only perception, connected with the moment without evaluation.",
          "Later note: I couldn't re-enter Big Awareness.",
          "Pure awareness is the realization of finally having found home after an eternal search.",
          "Awareness unclouded by thought or sense information, but not without this information either.",
          "May this assist in your assertion of my and others imperceptible experiences.",
          "My experience of pure awareness is full of contradictions—empty and full, light and dark, both smooth and rough.",
          "Or is absolute awareness meant?",
          "In this way, there is awareness of awareness (because the content is no longer disturbing the perception of awareness as such), but this goes much deeper than just what is captured by the words 'pure awareness', since what is really appearing is the fact that any appearing is the non-appearing of what does not appear.",
          "The state of pure awareness is a state in which one virtually removes one's own consciousness from the body, as if \"standing beside oneself.\"",
          "I must add that the description in terms of \"pure awareness\" or \"awareness of awareness\" only partly reflects my experience.",
          "Pure awareness happens as something physical, holistic.",
          "I experience awareness as an experience of emptiness in the sense of undefined harmony with simultaneous cognitive ability.",
          "I am only aware of existing.",
          "Years later, this is the closest I've come to absolute pure awareness.",
          "With each further onset of consciousness, awareness fades away.",
          "But this very attempt fails at this specific point of pure awareness.",
          "The big awareness was beyond it.",
          "And that my awareness of being aware makes me laugh and smile, because it was always there and how could I have been so ignorant of the key to everything.",
          "You could say the concepts of simplicity, purity and cleanliness are a major embodied constraint on me successfully aligning into the kind of state that resembles 'pure awareness' to me, and yet I think it is at least the right concept/phenomenon that you are investigating.",
          "Although there were some points of overlap in terms of the emotional and insightful qualities, it is ultimately completely different: especially with regard to the aforementioned complete \"normality\" of the state of pure awareness.",
          "I regularly practice in my meditation practice the awareness of awareness (or the awareness of awareness?).",
          "I am very aware in the wide, unlimited field of being."

          "Yet this specific experience was somehow different.",
          "These experiences cannot be produced by willpower or repeated on demand.",
          "Polarities aren't experienced as polar, so for many questions, my answer would be 'neither' or 'yes and no,' indicated by the middle position of the slider.",

          "As mentioned, the experience is hard to put into words.",
          "It's hard to determine if the experience was/is 'mine'.",
          "But the experience itself in my opinion is best described by the term non-conceptual.",

      "My first experience that would fit your description of \"consciousness of consciousness\" occurred at a very young age.\n",
      "At 16, I came into contact with Zen.\n",
      "Initially skeptical, I declared that I had no interest in meditation.\n",
      "After a year of almost daily meditation, I participated in my first sesshin, later (after studying Japanese studies) I became a monk in a Zen monastery in Japan.\n",
      "Each meditation means a different experience.\n",
      "When I then believed that this would kill me, and yet completely surrendered to it (\"Let the other monks bury me here tonight!\n",
      "Therefore, I have mostly understood my Zen practice as not focusing my attention on the inner observer (the lonely spectator in the cinema), but forgetting the seat in the cinema and instead re-identifying myself with the actor on the screen and the ever-unfinished script.\n",
      "My experience of consciousness occurred during meditation; suddenly I felt as if my body was dissolving and becoming something like energy.\n",
      "I experienced pure awareness during a meditation session.\n",
      "Before I meditated, I was in a depressive state, filled with great sadness and heaviness.\n",
      "During meditation, I entered a bright (non-visual) mental weightlessness that was boundless and yet offered a non-tactile/non-visual space of security.\n",
      "After the meditation, my emotional state was still depressive, but filled with the certainty of being able to free myself from it at any time for moments that seemed timeless.\n",
      "In winter, during my long, full-time Zen meditation practice in a temple, after 6 months of meditation (my first time ever), I sat in front of a glass door and was seeing the corridor outside the doors.\n",
      "It was my first experience of \"awareness\" in meditation.\n",
      "During zazen retreat, I sometimes feel everything is more natural than usual.\n",
      "While meditating, I entered a state that felt completely detached from everything else.\n",
      "Another situation that occurred during meditation: I sat there with my eyes closed and noticed how I was leaving my body.\n",
      "In meditation, my experienced state was characterized above all by the absence of something: pressing thoughts, memories, worries, distractions of the senses, etc.\n",
      "Here is a description of the experience I selected for this survey: During the time I was meditating a mantra by Steiner (\"Die Weisheit lebt in Licht\") focusing on creating a sensation of light.\n",
      "At the time I practiced taking the light as a meditation object as I was falling asleep.\n",
      "I had also just exited retreat that lasted ca.\n",
      "a week and had been meditating ca.\n",
      "The level of concentration was very high, magnet-like, and I noticed that I was meditating spontaneously/effortlessly/automatically and that I was awake (in other words, I was in dhyana or access concentration).\n",
      "I was very happy after the experience as I had a sense of having had a direct experience of an underlying or overarching reality (more real than real/normal reality), and was reassured that these states really do exist, which I sometimes doubt, and that meditation can take you to places like this.\n",
      "As with every meditation session, today I also took a few minutes for open awareness.\n",
      "The sensations can vary greatly if I am influenced by strong emotions such as sadness at the time of meditation.\n",
      "Moments of great feelings of happiness also occurred more often over the years in meditation... very pulsating, very stimulating, but at the same time I was still, and the body as such was \"not\" perceptible, at least not in the usual, almost sluggish way.\n",
      "(Between all these things, however, most meditation sessions were rather boring, full of thoughts, sometimes even unwilling and strenuous.\n",
      "I have for some years practiced both mahamudra and Tibetan dream and sleep yoga.\n",
      "It is in this state where my experiences have occurred whereby I am a simple unified awareness, seemingly without the daytime qualities of ego.\n"

      "The world of the divine was opened to me, shifting the real world to a more relative plane.\n",
      "I felt a realization of all things I had done, by perceiving objectively the effect of my actions on others as if I had affected not them, but myself, both in terms of the good and the bad I had done.\n",
      "I relived my life, or what was important in it, but all at once, without a linear or chronological order, I relived everything as if objectively, morally, by clearly realizing the value of everything I had done, feeling the sensations of others, from the position of those or that which was receiving good and bad from me.\n",

      "I cannot render the question more precisely, but I consciously found myself facing the reason for my quest for the ultimate truth.\n",
      "Pure awareness is the realization of finally having found home after an eternal search.\n",
      "The main and almost exclusive contents of consciousness were light and awareness.\n",
      "I may be mixing sensations from different experiences of pure awareness in this report, as it is difficult for me to specifically recall one experience.\n",
      "Firstly, when recognizing one's natural state, the recognizer dissolves into its ground.\n",
      "Looking back at who knows this, one realizes the non-dual wisdom.\n",
      "That cannot be known by the mind.\n",
      "It was a clear awareness, but with no thoughts; non-dual (no subject-object, but not so much of wholeness).\n",
      "It was certainly not \"enlightenment,\" just the awareness manifested itself while no thoughts were present.\n",
      "It is the background awareness behind any thoughts and perceptions, and it knows itself.\n",
      "I am aware that there's no boundary separating me from the world, which is to say the world is experiencing itself here.\n",
      "Where I am looking from is radiant, dark self-luminosity filled with the world of phenomena, including thoughts, sensations, and emotions.\n",
      "I must add that the description in terms of \"pure awareness\" or \"awareness of awareness\" only partly reflects my experience.\n",
      "So from awareness of awareness then 2) awareness becomes aware of itself without my help.\n",
      "3) Then as awareness becomes where \"I\" am aware from (with a different, non-conceptual, non-head centered or non-mindful meditator centered sense of boundless, timeless no-self awake awareness) there is the first appearance of forms of consciousness like vibration, sensation, sound.\n",
      "It is here that there are two roads where I can remain a witness as a big sky awareness viewing the coming and going of things like birds and clouds or I realize/feel/know that all appearances are made of awareness.\n",
      "This is non-dual unity which is where qualities of bliss, unity begin so I call this pure consciousness because it is not pure awareness only, however pure awareness remains the foundation within forms of consciousness appearing.\n",
      "Pure consciousness or non-dual experience of emptiness is form is where I can move from (whereas there is no functioning from pure awareness) and I live from here until there is identification with one form of limited consciousness that leads to a feeling of a small separate self inside a body, looking out of my eyes.\n",
      "I see that synchronicity, in particular, shows the truth or reflects what one experiences.\n",
      "I am more in a state of pure perception; it visualizes itself to me as a kind of phantom of myself, black, something like a starry sky, but not stable, rather wavering.\n",
      "Whether or not this is considered an experience of pure awareness, I'm not positive.\n",
      "Then again, there was not a feeling of separation between knower and known; if anything it was that those two things felt the same.\n",
      "I strongly resonated with the description of pure awareness in the question: 'Did you have the feeling that this state was actually always somehow present in your past perception?'\n",
      "Time seems to dissolve, as does space, at the very moment when this knowledge simply enters the relaxed consciousness, I am fully aware of these qualities.\n",
      "I also really see/hear etc.\n",
      "Inner brightness fills the entire perceptual horizon, no more thoughts.\n",
      "Beside this sensation, the KIND of awareness becomes clear, much clearer than usual.\n",
      "In retrospect, it becomes clear that the experience was more complex than the term 'pure awareness' implies, so it was more than just 'presence' (of what???)\n",
      "I kind of felt like I was the awareness, but at the same time I was kind of observing it, but I am not sure whether the part that was observing was also being observed in its entirety.\n",
      "One difficulty with describing pure awareness is that, whilst you are experiencing it you are, by definition, not examining it intellectually.\n",
      "In between the thoughts, pure awareness is utterly without conceptual content and I feel very relaxed.\n",
      "When a thought arises from pure awareness, it is allowed (not forced) to dissolve back into pure awareness.\n",
      "I experienced this awareness as a distinct state of consciousness that came on its own and passed after a while (many minutes, few hours).\n",
      "Rather, I was identified with an awareness that perceived these thoughts and feelings without itself feeling anything.\n",
      "I could actually notice awareness narrowing down and being \"obscured\" a little bit (like a window or a pair of glasses becoming dirty: there still is vision, but somewhat blurred).\n",
      "I strongly identified with the question \"Would it be an appropriate description to say that your pure awareness – in recognizing itself – also recognized itself as the awareness that had always been present in all past experiences?\"\n",
      "The senses of hearing and feeling are often very active in me; I perceive things in my closer surroundings as if I were standing next to them.\n",
      "At the same time, I feel the feelings when it comes to people who communicate or sense them without identifying with them or suffering from them.\n"
