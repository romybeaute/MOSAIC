Flashes of my past, seeing my lovely Mum.

It felt like I was deep in the ocean.
It was dark, but also a brilliant blue.
I wasn't drowning, instead it felt like that's where I was meant to be.
A sense of place akin to home, almost a calling or draw to be submerged away from the world and in my own space where I could float and simply exist without any interruptions.
Anxiety, loneliness, my inner child screaming for love, screeching.
i felt intensely anxious and a bit suffocated but also knowing that i've got this.
I embraced my inner child, allowed it to sulk, scream and cry, coming out with a mix of intense feelings but knowing that I could handle them.
The music took me on a whole journey, I was completely surrounded.

At first , hearing gongs i saw myself in sammiling's buddhist retreat  ans imagined myself totally relaxing and at peace.
As the music pace and volume increased, i saw horses galloping at increasing speed and at some point, i was on a horse too.
