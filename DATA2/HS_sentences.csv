  I didnt feel in control and wondered how this would be positive.
"   But then I found I could shut it out if I wanted and was able to relax -almost falling asleep at times"
In the experience the colours changed and the patterns.
   Sometimes it was like sunrise and othertimes like something from science  fiction with blue backgrounds and white linked rectangles.
"good beats leading me on helpful and positive ambient sounds
felt similar to being in an mri machine.

"1st time it felt more like it was separate from me, in front of my vision, 2nd time it was all around."
 no difference between me and what was happen.
 it was a bigger more profound but almost intense.
the dreamachine has put me in quite a strange but amazing mood and i want to catch that while it's still there.
 it is very sensitizing and the feeling now is one of afterglow.
 it is very wonderful seeing the deep textures and powdery lights that arise in your vision.
 the best bit was taking in the feelings of the music and gliding with it and morphing those visions according to how you feel about the music.
 i had a memory from my childhood of spending lots of time staring at the windows media player audio visualiser while listening to songs i liked and how that seemed amazing at the time.
 and this made me think about synesthetic experiences and how they're very precious and worth seeking out and appreciating.
 like this - music is a very visual thing

 And then maybe backwards.

 I felt like i was walking with my dog.
 All normal experiences usually but this time everything was scary.

 in some sense it was tiring.
 the hallucinations created a very intense and vivid world that if you stayed with it threatened to overwhelm at times.
" i could feel some sort of physical effect/stess or pressure on the front of my brain, on my face that almost felt as if it was taking a hit from each pulse of light."
 the moments without the flashing lights were blissful.
" having taken hallucinogens in the past, it lacked a narrative and an emotional connection comparatively- the scientific ture of the presentation perhaps cutting one off from an emotional and spiritual potential although this is probably highly subjective."
 it was exhausting in a similar way though.
 i must go and eat something.
a time and a place that seem to have happened but has yet to come
"Outside a kelidoscope of colour was a rotating universe of stars, just beyond everything."
"At one point it felt like i was looking up at buildings which were white, curved and modernist, like a futuristic city."
fabulous experience.
 I didnt want it to end.
 It was like having yours eyes open throughout and yet totally enveloped in the sound
"I heard  various music patterns,  different speeds and high and low notes."
 The music seemed to build to a crescendo near the end of the session  a d then move into a slower calming sequence.
 It enhanced the patterns and made it feel like a journey.
"geometric paterns in 2 colour mainly, sometimes with white dots in between."
 They moved rapidly in my direction from a shape in the centre.
 Sometimes they moved in the opposite direction towards the centre point.
 Like a kaleidoscope but more linear.

Good vibes

a zeen experience
I at times felt a concern that the experience would end too soon
"a portal moving towards me, away from me, through me, fractaling into everything"
"I found the experience very moving and emotional.
" Transcendental, peaceful although I also felt somewhat anxious."
I participated in a pschycedelic trial of DMT 7 months ago and this experience took me back to that.
 The music especially was on par with how one perceives sound during an actual trip.
"I find myself feeling peaceful and present, like back then."
This is a truly amazing experience.
Hard to describe.
Thank you for creating it.
"i thought of the universe, it felt , like i was moving moving to  the centre, drawn in ."
"i saw honeycomb shapes and thought of bees
"when i saw blocks of colour of red or yellow felt  dramatic !
The experience felt almost transformative.
" As the lights started and gradually built, I moved between states of mindfullness and being distracted by everyday thoughts."
 Sometimes wrestling between the two.
  It crescendoed into a cacophony of sound and light where I reached a state of full awareness.
 My arms were weightless and parts of my body felt distant or unrecognisable.
flashing patterns and music distracted from linear or ratiol thinking so just sat back and enjoyed sensory pleasure of colours and music.

" They were happy 
"like i was particles or a star emiting light into space
"Like an interactive, multicoloured, multidimensional Escher painting"
"I really enjoyed the music, it was very Zen."
towards the end i went to space.
 the take off was intense and scary but at the end i was floating peacefully in orbit with the glow of the earth below me.
 i could see the stars above me
"hard to focus on a single pattern and when you wanted to focus on one, it would become less focused."
 you just had to let them pass through you and you would be able to see them clearer
it felt like coming home 
"Intro was red spirals,almost like a cyclone"
"at first i thouhht it was really intense, but as i went through the phases, i felt a rush of anxiety taking me through a journey of colour; both beautiful and calming,or rigid and uncomfortable, ididnt know where to look."
" then, all of a sudden i felt like i was disembodied, a huge wave of euphoria took over and i felt like i was totally free, its the most comfort i've ever felt and it was magical "
"calm serenity, flashback emotions"
"It felt like being at a fun fare on a spinning ride but two next to each other spinning in opposite directions, but the light was a lot more mottled, reds and greens."
i felt like i understood why islamic architecture featurees geometric shapes so promintly.
 because we see these shapes when we close or eyes.
 obviously spiritual
the visual experience felt a bit flat sa focused in being in my eyes and head experience too much.
 i would rather engage the body and work on somatic aspect of it.
 so i dropped into the body to feel more.
" and it felt like i was a flat surface, lie a canvas and my face was a painting on which and images appeared."
"i remembered beautiful and joyful memories and moments with my family, asif i was with them at the beach"
i dissolved into light
I felt like I was looking across the Universe beyond any realm of experience.
 I felt deep connection with humankind and an overwhelming sense of peace.
 I left feeling profoundly moved and very tearful.
it sparked much curiosity.
 what do i really understand?
changing colours.
 interlocking diamond and triangles faintly distinct.
 the light appear to grow and shrink.
alot of memories
A varying journey in speed and awareness.
" At times so rapid it felt as though the body and brain wouldn't be able to process, while other moments were calm and soothing."
" Desire to retain and recall shapes colours and feelings evoked were strong, but understanding the experience may be lost once coming out of it."
Colour fields or varying colours which the changed to rapidly moving patterns.
" Sometimes the patterns appeared to move downwards in front of my eyes, sometimes across my vision, sometimes towards a point of infinity."
"felt like dreaming, i did dream a little"
"brains, neurons, veins, elephants, "
"lots ofvisuals ,but towards the end  people i love, and the ancestors, some i did not previously know, these were then apparent to be within an eye , good and bad stories were immaterial , just experiences , then out of the eye into a wider space of colours and reverberating patterns ,  and there were many eyes with many perceptions born of many lifetimes witnin them."
all these eyes were within the  the flow of colours.
  inside and outside the syes were infinite.

 And lots of kaleidoscope shapes
A bubbling of freedom.
 Suddenly seeing somewhere dark yet bright resulting in a tingling sensation through alternative parts of my body but also of pure relaxation
loved it.
 would like to try it for a couple of hours
What surprised me this time (4th experience of high sensory) was seeing peripheral live structures - pyramidal shapes.
Another thing which found strange was seeing clearly a pentagram in the centre of spiral - normal one as well as reversed and then rotating.
I felt at one point that i saw someone leave the room (like a dream) also we all lifted up and spiralled like a waltzer.
 I saw many kinds of patterns from sparks to geometric shapes and contrarotating spirals.
 My feet feel a bit floaty.
At times i saw a clear blue ocean.
 i saw people in yellow who were walking past me as if i was on a bus.
" there were lots of children playing with their parents, throwing balls in the air."
 various characters who if focused on them would disappear.
 at the end when everything calmed down i saw a person amongst the white in a hospital bed.
" i then saw a hazy silhouette of a man walking away from me, he looked over his shoulder before disappearing."
 filly there was a pregnent mother amongst blue being cradled by her husband.

" great sense of adventure and wellbeing, i was the traveller and welcome ontheir peaceful world"
I saw a lot of fast movement but despite that emotionally I felt absolute stillness and deep calm.
 On the periphery of my vision I sometimes saw objects and people.
" I tried to interpret them first, but then decided just to be fully present in the experience."
" Overall, I enjoyed dreamachine, i can still feel stillness and some feeling of bliss."
A euphoric and healing experience.
I FELT AS THOUGH I WAS EXPERIENCING THE FORMATION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE EARTH.
A PLACE OF WARMTH AND LIGHT ARISING OUT OF DUST AND SPINNING CHAOS SUSPENDED IN AN INFINITE VOID.
"i kept thinking about a game of football i played on tuesday and how i was hyper aware of my eyes, if they had something in them or something that might pull me awzy from the experience"

i was in another world
I saw a serene beach scene with people and text as if it were subtitled in a movie set in the south of France.
my brain being an Oscar worthy director
a totally immersive experience it felt like i was inside my very own kaleidoscope.
" i saw bright yellow, like the sun and it took me to my happy place "
As the guide's voice began to speak telling us it was over  I felt as if the colours had stopped some time before.
" I realised any interaction had been quite short as my consciousness had drifted into the early stages in which the sand man cometh, where my brain's alpha waves quickly displaced the exterlly generated momentary visions with the garbled, messy, free association of non-sensical stories that act as the scent kindling of dreams."
I felt sleepy and a bit anxious at times due to the speed of the flashing lights.
 i did not have profound thoughts during the experience but rather almost fell asleep in a dreamlike way
I was on a rollercoaster into the sun.
 Don't make me get off!

This is my 7th visit.
This wouldbe a great therapy to teach mindfulness and train people to still their thoughts.
"Also possibilities for recreational use "
Perhaps even people who want to get off drugs.
More DM please!
A feeling of peace and tranquillity
"i was put in a dreamlike semi-conscious state, the sensation when you are not quite asleep, coming into wakefulness, and dreaming of real things, conversations."
 this was unnerving sometimes.
 amazing experience though.
"I  felt that God's light shone upon me and that I was going back to the beginning of the universe, the Big Bang, and seeing creatures in microcosm - at a cellular level- as well as planets and stars."
" Also at the end, the depths of the ocean."
like being on acid or dmt but safer!
 everyone should try
fasciting experience with great thrapeutic potential
Colours like a testcard at first lightly muted but then i called pink to mind and saw a wash of deep pink.
 I also saw some text almost like ancient runes.
 At one point I felt like Iwas flying.
 I remembered some difficult experiences during but afterwards I felt euphoric
"a lot of kaleidoscope flowers, falling blossoms or snow flakes and ripples like rain drops on water"
Overarching ture and love.
"in brief - i was thinking if death could look like this experience, and so i decided to assume that i go through near death experience and check my thoughts about it, so you could build smth more thzn visual only thing to me, so i cannot say it was totally  useless as i was expecting"
different thoughts about the perception of light and the manner in which human descernment develops towards something.
struggled to let go.

 It was really hard to put my finger on it .
 I was shedding different layers of myself and felt connected to all life forms.
 I felt so much energy pulsating through my body 
"It transported me into memories, having a deeper connection than ever before."
"i could walk around the room and almost reach out, it felt like I was therein my memory looking back at the places."
 It was so deep I was unsure if I was totally conscious.
 It felt like almost the dream like state of anesthesia 
aware of the music tgroughout and changing rythms and tones
Very interesting experience.
 Definitely easy to be in the moment.
 Reminded me of when I used to get bored in school assemblies and press into my eyes to watch the patterns unfold!
" Most visuals were kaleidoscopic, although I saw a Moroccan landscape and a dolphin swimming away through a cave at various points."
I saw the insideof my eyelids in a whole new way.
Was starting to fee lfar more significant/interesting emotions when the experience stopped
I experienced a range of images which is why i chose so many colours and shapes when asked to describe what i saw.
 perhaps i should have focused on one.
" i saw octagonal like shapes, i saw rotations and like i was being washed over by yellow light."
 the most intense part was smooth but heavy and intense red light that mixed with yellow like fire and looked like a spaceship that was moving.
 Like an eruption of light and an engine firing.
 Thank you it was very interesting
To be quite honest i think i fell asleep so dont really rememberwhat i saw.
"i thought the fluffy speech and over written health and safety aspect broke any sense of adventure or departure, was it really necessary? the meditive part was nice perhaps take the intro time up with a brief overview of the history of these pursuits a bit science and lose the faux hand holding."
 lovely experience overall
An intensity of connectionvastnessspaciousnesslovi ngawareness
deep relaxation.
 like a deep tissue massage for the mind.
 a safe healthy groovy drug-free trip.
 how long did it last? afterwards i felt as if i had had the deepest  deepest sleep.
 i worried it might give me a headache but it didnt.
 great peace.
colourful patterns
Peace and contentment.
I saw hexagons and a blue tunnel.
 I thought of bees and generativity.
" I was pure and full of electricity,"
frustration that i couldnt stop thinking about the outside and concentdate on what was happening.
 but there were occasiol tumbles in the patterns that made me leap back into it
A really pleasant and relaxing sensation.
" It was not erotic, but it did make me think of sex in the sense that it struck me how enjoyable it could be to have a sexual experience (alone or with others) in conjunction with or after that sensation."
"I also felt like i wanted the experience to be more intenlse - much louder "
"music, and the most intense part of the lighting pattern repeated for longer."
some physical discomfort; amazing patterns; intense colours; yearning; desire to see more; questions
"I felt incredibly small, and had the weight of exsistence over me like a heavy blanket."
 Rather than a negative experience I felt relief and comforted by it
"immense comfort, even when much of the experience was frantic."
 towards the end i saw deep blue snow which was incredibly peaceful 
lights and  colours.
 a sense of calm.
"I very suddenly fely like I had been shot into the air, travelling up through time and space."
" I saw stars pass overhead, with everything taking on a kalaeidoscopic texture."
" I also saw an alogue timer counting up, filling my whole field of view."
a perfectly cromulent experience
relaxing and patterened music
a journey into the unknown.
 a beautiful quest to oblivion
"I experienced different states depending on the lighting - darkness and constant light made me feel relaxed, but the first two levels of strobing made me feel partly overwhelmed and anxious."
 The fil (most rapid?) level of strobing felt more relaxing again.
I felt very powerless and pulled along during the experience.
 like i was being dragged along a space portal or tunnel at a very high speed.
 i saw stars and the outlines of planets.
 i saw a large cross.
 two wolf shapes facing each other.
 i saw a large butterfly/dragon shape descending from the stars.
 i saw a large huge open space paterned with what looked like white and black tiles.
 i saw large ske like shapes writhing through the space and tunnel each a different colour
"felt out of my body - in fact off planet earth - like i took a trip into space"
this is my 2nd time.
 the 1st one was better coz i felt relaxed and i got ideas.
 this time someone kept coughing and disrupted my thought process.
 i did not feel anything at all.
" they should ban people who cough"
"i was moved by a wild tide of atomic energy, converging around all of us"
"Colours, patterns and a sense of awe that my brain and light were creating such powerful hallucitions."
 I was a little afraid at first but it was good to get in touch with my fear and just feel it.
 It was a beautiful experience.
"similar stuff to what i normally experience"
"i often felt connected to space, as in floating weightless surrounded by millions of stars."
 or travelling at great speed through time.
 Sometimes it felt and looked like wormholes.
 I felt elated and completely peaceful and found myself smiling broadly at these moments
"that was like acid"
was an interesting experience and after i felt relaxed 
just music 
"at the end the sharp music  connected me to sound of helicopters with a smell of burning that i associated with a war, for majority i experienced heart shapes  cosmic lights and galaxies "
Peace  tranquility  joy stimulation arousal.
 swirling patterns.
 geometric shapes shifting and changing  i got lost my body disappeared and came back.
"  i had short dreams  "
Thought about how I was feeling and that there were people around  me and how it made me feel vulnrable.
i felt as if i were in outerspace or as if i was experiencing a transition after death.
" it was comforting and whilst i felt small and insignificant, i also felt free and powerful."
Joy and relaxation
i thought throughout i was visualising my own body specifically my head.
my thoughts of this is i felt safe and fun.
 it gives me an odd feeling of wanting to keep feeling these types of thing again
lots of colors
I was aware when i started to follow my train of thought i was maybe going deeoer into myself and i didnt see as much of the imagery as when i did whdn i was concentratingon the colours and the shapes.
 i spent a lot of time thunjing about the way i experience the world sensorially and whether it is 'normal' compared to other people.
a wild ride
"a kaleidoscope of light and patterns"
i was on a journey i was relaxed and not a bit worried as if i knew would be safe
"random thoughts  some connected to people close to me  others just events and journeys"
"A sense of expansion "
"moving towards  something "
"Forward motion"
"Motivation, progress and purposes "
"Mainly stressed but with moments of calm when it went dark and blue, I saw lots of colours and patterns but i didnt like a lot of them so found myself hoping it would become a colour combition i like or find emotionally peaceful."
" there was one point where it had a darker background and was starry and had bright pink, yellow and blue shapes dancing which i liked."
" but most of it had a white background for me which made me feel like i was in a clinical space, that made me stressed, i generally prefer the dark."
"floating in the air and travelling in the universe"
"flowers blooming"
"if youre from the University of Sussex you need to stand up for reality not believe in souls , gendered or otherwise"
"Breathing exercize:"
it would help if the staff could show us how to do it so we could copy them.
 The way it was delivered was too fast and too long.
 it wasn't with my rhythm.
i found the eye mask uncomfortable on my forehead so i took it off.
 i would prefer to use my hands to shield from the light.
it was a bit too cold for me in the dreamachine especially as we were not moving.
"it is quite echoy in the dreamachine and i could hear someone snoring, and when staff was openin & shutting thedoor near beginning and end."
it might be an idea to have a box of tissues in the reflection room.
"light shapes, emerging and receding patterns folding in and out ofeash other."
 kaleidoscope effects.
" it wasalso interesting, when an image stabilised, to scan the field of vision up and down and side fo side to explore the periphery."
Lots of pulsating spiralling images that did not take specific forms.
"I experienced a lot of physical sensations in my stomach, on my face and inside my head."
 I still feel it now.
 Like my brain has been massaged.
"something that i had ever experienced before, something i wish i could do once a week"
i kept seeing images og peop.
entry another univerise
"saw vertical tree branches with green leaves towards the end, felt as though was moving in a sleep state at that point"
I also experienced ghost people in my purifferal verison.
 sometimes fleeting or felt they where walkjng around the room.
 whispy and milky in apperence.
i am also dyslexic a d itwasinteresting to experence as nuero divergent brained person
"for someone who has sleep paralysis regularly, this was quite interesting."
" my brain automatically reached for the details that prove this wasn't real, and I felt very much present."
" couldn't meditate either, even though i tried."
 the visuals were pretty fun though
sequential rich kalidescopic patterning with a sense of depth    structures felt ite and tural rather than architectural or fantastical  or transcendental.
A kaleidascopic 'Be our Guest' from Beauty & The Beast experience.
 I kept seeing happy spinning teapots!
"having had many psychedelic experiences over many years it was tame, interested in potential for taking it further, combining it with substances."
"Felt being pulled through a vortex of time, waiting to awake in a different dimension!"
healing a part of myself i didn't realise had decayed entirely
felt like i was on that boat in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
deep memories and emotive reflections.
images ive seen before.
"I saw something like a moroccan tile pattern based around small geometric crosses and diagols, lots of them, lots of flickering and moving, sometimes focusing in particularly to one shape more than the others."
" This was all very colourful - lots of small different blocks of colour, but repetitive, as in the shapes and colours repeated."
" Sometimes a couple of colours became more domint, like blue and red, or a more fluffy green pattern."
  A couple of times the small geometric shapes started as grey / black & white.
" Sometimes (felt like beginnings and ends of musical or light episodes) there were periods of stillness with just one colour, mainly a warm yellow, or an orangey red."
stimulation and relaxation within the music and light
I saw incredible kaleidoscopes of patterns made of solid stripes of colour.
" Through the edges of the kaleidoscopes I started to see corridors and gardens, as though there were doorways to imagined world inside the patterns."
 At one moment when it was darker i saw a deep mass of blue green sparks that pulsed almost like a jelly fish.
I wanted to stay in that space and see more of those worlds.
"space even if ive never been physically there
"A mass of moving shapes and the most vivid colours, continually changing, evolving and enveloping "
amazing sense of peace and positivity
very interesting!
"Colours and lines and spheres and twirls
sensory rollercoaster
really just thoughts from my day or things i need to do or had forgotten to do.
"Seeing figures wearing black hats at the height of the music, banda stars twirling, tunnels slanting right and left as well as zooming in, and the creamsicle room."
 totally disorienting until i picked a spot or tried to blink.
 lots of uncertainty but it went okay.
"Quite a few meshes orders of dark colours emerging from blackness but at one point
" hexagons of pulsating pink and black began punching me from both sides altertely
"It lasted about 6seconds but if it had gone on longer I would have had to
"I felt relaxed, safe and excited at the start of the experience."
 Then I began to float through a tunnel filled with bright red and blue light into outer space or some other dimension.
" My body felt heavy with a sense of sinkining down, but at the same time I was flying forward."
" As the experience intensified, I felt euphoric and emotional."
" Like I was on  a LSD trip, an out of body sensation when I am on drugs."
 It was quite satisfying.
 I think it helped me process some of the trauma I had with drug use.
" At the end of the journey, I was back to Earth floating in dark blue, purple water."
 I wanted it to go on forever.
"ever-shifting visions, often kaleidoscopic, geometric, or cosmic, which were linked to the music and could be shaped by intention, but obliquely and mysteriously."
 As if taken through alterte realities by an unintelligible but considerate guide!
"A geometrical, rythmic, pulsating cosmos in front of my eyes."
 It was  infinently varied and beautiful.
 I will return in my own time without the help of the dream machine.
Seeing and hearing my deceased relatives.
 They all smiled and i could hear their distinctive voices.
life death and rebirth
"red all red
"shapes and travel through .
"Anxious and overwhelmed, total lack of control at first."
 I realized I had to give myself (entregarme) to the experience if i wanted to feel it.
 An emotional and somatic understanding that control has no place here.
" Then I saw planets revolving rapidly, almost colliding."
 Me in a spaceship travelling so fast i felt i was leaving my body behind.
 Approaching the sun and its heat.
" Then a cartoonish face of a man with a moustache reflected like a disco light, and ceiling fans that i approached and zoomed out of (from the collective of many fans to the intricacies of the single fan)."
" Then i jumped into my own bloodstream, i could see the red blood cells travelling in its flow with me, i could almost feel the warmth of my own blood as i floated and flowed in it."
" Then a squirrel, and bioluminescence of the ocean, la gigi, to end"
huge 3d landscapes.
 Flashing backgrounds undulating into the foreground quuckly becoming a new perspective
I felt warm and cold sensations in my hands at one point and was very relaxed and sleepy by the end.
 I found the flashing lights a little intense but the eye mask worked well for me during those times.
 Overall an enjoyable and relaxing experience.
"A collection of keyholes that i could see a paintingthrough, animals and merpeople morphing into each other, wireframe structures, an 'Up' (the animated movie)-style montage of my future?"
Changing temperature of my body with the lights.
Changes in intensity of the experience when i focussed compared to when the light was across my whole peripheral vision.
pleasure & intrigue
"travelling through space"
"i thought a lot about rands journey into rhudian and experiencing the history of the aiel through the eyes of his ancestors 
the  visual here doesnt look anything like what i saw.
" was much more geometric, kaleidoscopic, not at all sky like."
