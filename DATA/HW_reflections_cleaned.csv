"Felt like how I feel in the split second before falling asleep, but instead of it lasting a second it lasted a while. My body felt heavy but also weightless but at the perfect level, and my mind was gradually receding it into a calm safe space. Before that I was going between feeling almost anxious/ out of control, and euphoric - almost how it feels on MDMA. I has brief moments of vivid memories - live music concertns, moments as a teenager on drugs and feeling very in the moment. I had visuals but they weren’t really the main thing for me. There were times they felt at a distance but would be more closer, and sometimes they were so close they sort of consumed/ blocked my vision (mind? Clarity? thoughts?) and that brought almost anxiety. But i was able to pull myself away and refocus (i do this in day to day life with my anxious thoughts. I don’t really remember.)"
"Surreal
Connection to other dimension, in a galaxy where there is peace and gratitude prosperity and life beyond what reality is. "

Drifted into different stories, saw intense colours and graphic spinning 3d patterns. Some anime trees appeared. At points, I was bombarded by Tetris-like cubes. A green garden appeared near the end. Stars flowed down curving slopes.
"
"At the session start, I could only see orange and blue (orange at the top, blue at the bottom). As the stroboscope accelerated I started seeing more colours, from purple to very light blue. Throughout the whole session I saw only geometric shapes, from little squares to bean-shapes and circles expanding. When the stroboscope would stop I would see uniform colours across the field of vision, from deep blue to pure white. I moved my eyes up and down, right to left to see if there would be different shapes but actually whatever I saw in front of me was also present at the periphery. When the flash light accelerated I would see smaller shapes (like cubes) and those shapes would be larger as the frequency of lightstrokes would slow down. I don’t think the music influenced me that much, it was much more down to the light effects. "
"Patterns were the main ‘visual’ when my eyes were closed. A Lot of triangles matrices patterns, when I tried to focus on the patterns they would begin to move in a spiral motion."
"Intense bright light, centred on a set of squares which spun into a opal shape. The colour of which changed from white, orange, red to yellow.. At other times, a range of shapes similar to a kaleidoscope (not sure I spelt that right). Typically started out in white and black. Then it would transition mainly to blue. Later stages the colours red, green and yellow dominated the shape colours. At any given time, I would look around and the shapes would ‘run’ away. If I focused on the centre, the shapes moved more orderly. The changing of shapes was very timed, it didn’t flow into each but started, reached a peak, then slowed down, then changed through a cycle into darkness."
"It felt like I was travelling in space at hyperspace then slowing down. I was overwhelmed at the start but I let myself go and travelled with the sound, lots of pinks, whites, blue and red. It totally relaxed me to the point I nearly fell asleep."
"Geometric patterns in movement. Walking into a tunnel of geometric patterns, changing colours everytime the rhythm’s changing."
"I saw a lot of squares travelling in lines in front of me. Mostly red and blue, and when they faded I saw green stars. Any circles I saw were black and white. A lot of the time I felt like I was moving quickly. Overall very cool and enjoyable!"
"Felt with one with one self, felt Relaxed at points level tanking, felt like I was floating through the universe and at times like light speed, the colours and patterns were amazing, colours that were bright were Reds, Purples, blues, Yellows, I think the experience comes close to when your on psychedelics, ie Acid, mushrooms etc, at points I felt like my third eye was being activated and my eyes were being pushed up and I was seeing it from my pineal gland, (third eye) etc, What a great experience highly recommend, think could help anxiety and depression possibly. Shows us as we are and that’s Waves + frequencies."
Initially felt overwhelmed and had to put eye mask over my eyes. Once I focused on my breathing and tried to relax myself I started to enjoy all of the colours and displays. I felt that I was swimming in the deep ocean and travelling through space - in a happy place! Afterwards I felt thoroughly relaxed and calm. Ready to face the day. I wish everyone could have this experience. 
In the darkroom I found light. The experience was very enriching and soothing to mind and eyes. Not sure if I was relaxed. Or I was in a different world. It was a great show!!!
"It started as the sky, then developed into the cosmos. I saw galaxies, nebulas, gas clouds, I felt like how it would feel to go down a black hole, I felt like I was atom’s, travelling through the universe. Towards the end it felt like I was dropped into the ocean, the pounding drumming music felt like I was inside a Whale being taken through the ocean, then expelled out to sink into the deep by myself. It was very peaceful. At times intense but focusing my breathing helped me keep in control and enjoy the experience. 

Thank you for this.

Warm summers day back when I was 3 / 4 years old back at my house where I grew up. Yellow strokes of sunny ‘feeling’ with red and brown slow. Looking up in the sky to see down on myself like I’m watching my life going forward. Seeing my family. Light blue wherever I seen my breath. The yellow made me smile a lot. The whole pattern gave me a sense of peace and happiness that I haven’t had in a long time. Made me feel like I am safe and in a good place in life.
"Felt calm and peaceful.
Saw geometric patterns, sometimes moving sometimes not.
Blue and red were main colours.
I was thinking about my week past."
"I saw static with a bit of a cinefilm filter. It had a sort of heated into in acetate on overhead projector feel. 

I feel there is another music mix where Jon Hopkins had his trademark nastiness. It seemed a little nice for my liking and would have just liked it to be a bit more horroresque. But I appreciate that is me. And generally speaking nice is popular. 

Still very amazing. I did worry as i have a habit of very violently tapping my feet and I worried that the overseers would have thought I was having a seizure. 

Is interesting that white light is made of colours. I wonder how this would be without using LEDs."
"Organic shapes like shifting snow and sifting sand grew into moving sand dunes.
Later the shapes became much more geometric. I found myself half dreaming and these figures and thoughts moved around my field of vision.
At one point I became hyper aware of my body, some pulled muscles in my shoulder + finger zinged and throbbed at the same time and then I faded back into hazy, cozy disembodied relaxation."
"I felt like I was travelling through time and space and discovering new worlds. It was like being stuck in a kaleidoscope and experiencing each turn and each change. I would move from fast travel and whirling through colour until I came to a quiet world full of stars. Then the sun would shine a new. When the music slowed and relaxed I felt like I was in deep water serene and surrounded by luminescent plankton.
Even when it felt like I was travelling at high speed I still had a happiness and peacefulness about it."
"As if sub atomic on a journey
             Inside light and through it.

               Almost entering time travel and experiences in time and space within light."
"Transported through Galaxies, Nebula, Star systems, womb, kaleidoscopes, hexagons, Futures.
Rebirth!"
"Like being on a spaceship and also like being out in the sun.
I saw a lot of numbers falling and an eye.
A hand reached out from the light. "
"At times I felt the most amazing level of concentration, I forgot where I was and then the colours would change. I would feel euphoria and then feel like I was drifting off. The white light was amazing. I feel 20 years younger after this experience"

"I was so relaxed that I felt like I was floating but my feet still felt tingly. The colours and patterns were so intense but felt magical like I was travelling to a new dimension. Some of the patterns were so mathematical and geometric that I wouldn’t even be able to draw them with a computer. It was one of the strongest most beautiful experiences I have ever had.

"
"I saw a lot of flashing images that were mainly and connected. After each section of flashing lights ended it would fade to black. During this time I had a re-occurring set of shapes appear. They had a very specific “vintage” colour scheme of brown, pink, and orange and they were always squares. The first time the flashing lights faded to black there were only a few vintage squares surrounding the perimeter of my vision. Each time the flashing lights faded to black  a further time, more vintage  squares would appear. As time went on more and more vintage squares would fill the screen of my vision. This would always be from the outside of the perimeter to the inside with no gaps. My guess is that each time I reached the stage where the vintage squares would appear, I would become more comfortable and aware of the sudden shock of the flashing lights disappearing. Here is a visualisation of my experience."
"At first I was on a beach then when the light started flashing I was in a Rainforest. These two scenes were the only “real life” moments. After this it was just a journey of shapes. I saw a lot of spiky shapes and they were always flashing. I felt like my eyelids were fluttering a lot. I tried to think about certain things to see if they would translate into what I was seeing but it didn’t. I was always moving through the images… the colours and shapes would change so drastically and suddenly. When it went black I didn’t see much, then every time the flashing light started again I always saw robot-like, intricate, motherboard / circuit board like wires and connections."
"At the beginning I see a model of architecture floating in the space and spinning sky with red circles. I feel it’s hard to move my hands and eyes. Then I eventually into a dream. 
I see my girlfriend in it and I talk to her. Then I don’t know how much time passed I begin to wait and I find the music on the light became slow. Then I see the spinning sky again and the seaside appearing in front of me.
"
"Experience was largely visual although I had short periods of intense awareness why I lost my ‘self’ a bit. The visual phenomena mostly consisted of geometric shapes, circles and vibrant colours. I particularly enjoyed when both the music and lights vibrated/wobbled together, with a gradual (??) I really felt & was present with this vibration. Thanks to all involved who provided this experience :) 
"
"I saw a lot of water movements if different colours. It felt like a splash with different shapes and movement coming from it. I would see black and white squares, chequered moving side to side. I felt like I was getting sucked into a hole but in a very nice way. Blues and greens was the colour that would come to me the most but pink and orange was very vibrant and stood out to me. I felt so relaxed and safe, this experience was very beautiful 
"
"Like being inside a kaleidoscope, or a magic eye picture or a fractal drawing 
Zooming through the universe with ever changing patterns.
"
"felt - relaxed, happy 
saw - fireworks !! fractals vivid colours light explosions "
"Many geometric shapes (..especially hexagons) vivid colours or lines on a darker background - emanating from the centre and radiating outwards.
Occasionally saw letters in the bottom right or hexagons. sudden change of the patterns/colours for example reds/orange/ to blues/purples 
hexagons -  changing into circles / squares 
feeling - warm comfortable safe blissful
"
"I could feel that my body was sinking and I felt the gravity through my body. I saw a broad space, bright but not too bright, a space but not empty nor full.  It felt large and warm - however I felt a bit uncomfortable, like things filling in my mind connected to each other in a tangled and confusing way that made me feel not safe nor relaxed and rather made me want to feel empty and peaceful - but I couldn’t. My body still feels quite relaxed after the listening, but I feel tired in my head somehow that’s why I think my drawing shows spiky branches coming out of a much softer shape. I’m curious how I’d feel when I go outside and back to the daily life of today"
"I saw…
Brightly coloured geometric/hexagon all shapes bright (warm) Red blue green with white lie through the middle.
The shapes were tessellating and turning and pulsing with the music, in time to the music. whenever there was a poster black a new phase would begin with different shapes like an old school kaleidoscope with different colours. I move through it all and felt incredible warmth security and contentment.
everything is okay = even unexpected things & I enjoyed the journey."
"Spiralling Inwards / Outwards
a multicoloured kaleidoscope of colours. 
Travelling through time + space. Communing with a female (unknown to me) "
"Initially, I felt a little tense heart rate raised, but quite quickly focused on breathing, and I wanted to run/flow with the waves of shapes, travel in whatever direction they were leading me. I felt like I had to remain focused on my breathing to maintain calm and balance, and I was able to feel like although the experience was individual, I was experiencing it collectively. Towards the end it did feel more intense but focused breathing helped me to continue to travel with the flow."
"I saw at first what looks like a sun burst around a blackhole. Then what appeared was one half blue and on half red like fluffy flashing clouds. 
I then saw more defined white spinning pinwheels on a cream background.
I also saw black and white checkeredboard effect flashing with the squares growing bigger & smaller.
My favourite bit was near the end when it was black but the remaints of line was still tracing so it felt like I was journeying deep in space through seas of stars. "
"The slow transitions and music combined to give a great feeling of warmth. 
The faster transitions were almost physical and at one point I felt like I was being propelled forwards, like flying through a tunnel.
Joyful. The warm sea on my face. The adventure my brain takes me to. Smoking. Sensations draining in draining out. 
Submit to the crescendo full of soaking the energy of my inner world. Should be a thing like yoga or - feel so good after this"
"I saw a variation of things on repeat. Different colours, shapes, lots of spinning with an underlying pattern. Lots of layers. Overwhelming at times. Very, very abstract and no real feelings of emotions - thought a lot about how just white lights could result in such colour and movement. I hoped for something more concrete, but it was very similar to the music visualiser, like windows 98 screensaver!"
"
Started of seeing very regular shapes that formed predictable patterns that spiralled clockwise. Though the experience my min drifted and the lights/patterns softened.  I felt a sense of lightness and colour and patterns made me feel like I was lifting from the floor towards the tops of trees. The visuals were white 7 trees circling me. I was up by the tree and felt like there was no need to worry about falling. 
"
"I saw lots of different colours and shapes, the flowing light like the sun or like being born. Opening your eyes for the first time. In the darkness it was like space. Stars and galaxies. Travelling through it, being part of it. Countless dots of stars running past. Every shape, line, swirls, grid, circles horizon. Then I would sometimes see an eye in the middle. Open eye with eyelashes and an orange colour . When I kept seeing the eye it made me happy. And emotional hoary. It was small an in the centre - always moving.
Purple and blue and grey and black in the darkness. Yellow and orange and red and pink. Green and blue. Warm and renewing in the bright light. Calm and immersive and travelling in the darkness. "
"Like floating through a sky fortress of lego clouds. 
In another section an up-down eye-like slit which had black and red pulses emerging at time like bolts of lighting
A warmth of all, of flowing through another plane of existence, a feeling of being carried to nowhere and everywhere at once. "
"Bright daylight followed by intense moment. Initially saw snake-like movement throughout my vision but at the center there was always a circle of star of wherever I look. When the scene would change, I would get a barrier in my outer field of view sort of define where my vision ends. At some points I would get faces in my peripheral vision smiling at me. They were all black and white television show actor looking people. Sometimes I would feel as though I was being sucked in to a new place and there was an inevitability to it. I was entering a new plane and I had to just let go and accept the overwhelming force. I was sad when it ended it was truly amazing. "
"Thinking of the optical illusion of the moving horse - a series of still images that when moved at speed create one smooth moving image. For me dream machine was when the images slows down just enough when your brain can just detect the separate images. The music combined with the lights created the idea of moving towards a tunnel - almost like the 80’s attempt at showing hyperspace. 
I didn’t connect to any particular emotion or feeling - nothing terrible - more just the fascination that my brain was creating the sensation of movement and speed in reaction to music. 
"
"Unfortunately suffered from light sensitivity almost immediately so I left after the tester. But before I left I seen block colours changing into orbits. The brightest levels were mostly red and orange, these hurt for me - the lower lights were blue and green and didn’t hurt my eyes.
I also seen dots of lights jump & spin and a lot of kielodscope patterns.
I’m disappointed I couldn’t experience it for longer but now I know I have light sensitivity I guess. 
"
"galaxy’s unfolding, planets, shapes locked & connected. I saw one spider in the middle of all the light, I think this represents fear but I lent into it, the spider disappeared the the galaxys returned, infinite shapes & stars & life spilling out into the open.
"
"It felt like flying very fast through seas, deserts, rainforests and space "
"I saw a lot of red and white flashing at very high speeds. I think there may have been some patterns, but they were constantly being disrupted by the fast moving ripples. I felt like I was seeing something very violent and angry, and it was filled with a sense of menace. I remained aware of my body but still found the experience unnerving. "
"- Quite Trippy at times
- Happy
- Overwhelming in a good way
- Like I was in a time machine
- “     “  vortex 
- “     “ blackhole 
- Found the colours settled back to orange/brown like colour palette "
"A mix of deep revelation & wonder, euphoric of excitiment I remember from going to raves. I was wiggling in my seat - wishing / hoping for the beat to drop so I could get up and dance. 
"
"Intense and elevating, the flood of image was uplifting - with a wash of imagery filling my senses"
It felt similar to floating through space seeing swirls like galaxies. At stages I could see sharp checkered patterns of red + blue. The more I relaxed and let go the higher the detail in the visualisation 
"The experience started with a gradual sunrise illuminating in a lovely summer’s day with no patterns. Then the first experience was an orange-green kaleidoscope. This morphed into a checkerboard pattern that started rotating in 3D space and I could pick out some individual shapes (cylinders predominantly). When the lights dimmed, the colours changed to blue and purple and I started seeing more recognisable objects like people with no faces. The patterns changed too. Throughout the experience, I felt grounded and connected to myself. Feeling and seeing these kinds of things without being stimulated from and outside TV screen was amazing and it was a welcome disconnect from the real world.
"
"Unable to describe in words 
comforting 
safe 
free "
"I found the whole experience to be overwhelming to my eyes. 
"
"Most phases started with tundra colours, shapes of ice and blues stroking across my field of vision. Then a consistent honeycomb hexagonal pattern would assert itself. Swirling away from me as is in flight and going backwards or the patten is coming from me. The filling of the hexagonal would change, from snowflake patterns to blue bubbles to lush forest canopy and once a series of tigers faves. At one point the scope zoomed out and I could see that all my patterns were in the shape of a sphere, swirling around means for a few moments I could see the sphere of people next to me too. The last section when the sound went lower filled me with the feeling of WW2 airplanes and the images changed to peacock feathers but I found it unpleasant at the end, a bit uncomfortable. "
"There was a start spinning/flashing/drifting in the centre. Smaller star/arrow/diamond shapes were everywhere. It was mostly yellow/orange, sometimes white or grey. Even when the lights were off I could see purple fuzz drifting around.
"
"Although deeply relaxed, still felt like I was flying! An amazing experience to sit back and see where your mind and senses take you by simply being calm. The colours and the world rushed past whilst remaining still + calm - an amazing space to sit back and ‘be’! Thank you!!"
"It was a warm bright experience. The drawing reflects some of the latter experiences where I felt like my mind was travelling at the speed of a spectrum of warm - red - yellow - white tonality of colours. It was absolutely freeing and relaxing. And then it moved into a whole other branch of blues, purples and pinks. Then I shall have to admit to dozing off and waking up to the guide telling us to move out of the dreamchine…"
"Flat colour Red (not pink)
Then patterns - regular
Like holes in marshmallows or buttons on a sofa. When it went to black there was a green grid - the grid gradually reduced in size I think I could see text/characters/writing but couldn’t make out what it said. Overall a feeling of peace. "
"Completely ‘......’ followed by an empty sky. Experiment reminiscent of attending a rave (a long time ago!). Very comfortable and relaxed, felt safe and extremely well of mind."
"Mellow light
Stars and dots
Lines and sparks
I felt calm and peaceful with mellow light but uncomfortable and panic at first stars and flashing. I decided to stay, although at one point considered leaving. The breathing helped to ground me and felt I wanted to stay. I did feel I needed to use mask at points."
For Def it activated sensory devisions within my mind that I’m not normally exposed to. The combination of the music combined with unusable stimuli was revealing.
Remarkable. Brought deep thoughts. Seemed to open doors into my mind.
"Warm 

Smile

Elated

Clear mind

Spacious"
"So calm, I drifted off twice."
"Lots of colours - bold and soft 
Movement & emotion - turns up & down 
"
"I saw many variations of the same swirling patterns that reminded me of the stargate from 2001, as well as spiral galaxies rotating (sped up into infinity)... It felt like I was moving through a tunnel or cylinder of light and energy. The swirling patterns morphed into kaleidoscopic burst of diamonds/triangles when the light changed suddenly.
When the light faded towards darkness after the more intense sections, I saw/imagined more subtle images - from clusters of distant stars, to rain or snow against a black sky, or subtle networks of webs/filaments."
"I am a creative visual person. My mind can become a dark void of disassocition, empymess and lonelines. Light becomes a healer, a warmer, a cathatic. Brightness and saturation of colour reignite feelings, connectivity, purpose of being. Light and colours help me to feel human. Patterns offer me the ability to journey away, to adventure, to safely get lost and absorbed into another state. Thank you tall of the team who have worked on this project/ experience. xx"
"At the beginning it was pure red and very intense, then it calmed down a little and I started to see patterns. More colour appeared and the patterns moved in the rhythm of the music. I felt calm for most of the experience, if a little panicked at the start."
"At the start of each light coming up, it felt like the sunshine. Lots of psychedelic shapes and colours, initially only read and black, but soon the full colour spectrum came!
Completely lost concept of time, could have been 10 minutes or several hours, super surreal. Towards the end, felt like someone was cupping my face, not in a bad way, in an entirely comforting way! Thoroughly immersive and enjoyable.

"Congruent shapes
My eyes felt quite overwhelmed"
"Visuals like a nice whitey, after a night out raving without any yucky side effects. looked like a kalidescope. fractured pixilated blurred in parts.
I’d like to try again. see if it repeat. 
nearly always centre point but I though that merged with my direction of gaze. (I though so anyway)

"Honeycomb.

"A rush of chemical endorphins.

That was crazyyyyyy.

"
"Flashes of geometric shapes like a kaleidoscope (telescope) in lost of different colours + patterns, radiating inwards, outwards, spiralling and swirling across my view. Occasionally would feed burst of warm yellow loving light (still). Sometimes felt like I was looking at space space, sky, underwater, forest and rivers floating but no clear objects or shapes. When I pulled my eyes downwards I sometimes saw the people in the room opposite although I didn’t think I had my eyes open. Toward the end the music was scratchy and my eyes felt almost painful and wanted the noise
to stop. The geometric shapes and music were like disco pulses at time with many"
"The music very much added to the intensity of the images and colours I could see. The colours would change depending on what was happening with the music. At the height of the music, chaos, volume, intensity, the colour burst into a bright red. It was a very overwhelming sensation emotionally. For some of the beginning, it felt like the space in between being awake and falling asleep. "
"The experience was right on the edge of being too intense.

Those crazy thoughts you have at the brink of falling asleep - they just fade away as you try to grab them."
"Petals in bloom against a darker blue sphere, a pattern overlapping on itself as the ‘petal’ shapes twisted and ‘died’ (I guess?) and bloomed again."
"Kaleidoscope, pulsing, static rhombuses of different colours; flat lightscapes of pastel, fading into prisms I felt anxious at time when the pulsing lights became intense, but as the experience went on I became lost in a waking dream and drifted in about of actual sleep among the lights I saw a bird!"
"The rhythm and the lights felt like being in hospital going under anaesthetic. Kept seeing green, flatline, white diamonds, red stars.

Rushing waves, falling fractals."
"
Vortexes of colour, kaleidoscope patterns relentelessly - when the lights were more intense. Occasionally the patterns arranged themselves into recognisable objects, even people. I only saw people in the corners/foregrounf of my vision. I felt anxious a bit twitchy at some of the strobiest moments, but this would suside. The last portion was much more relaxed and I feel real-world objects appeared more. I might have fallen asleep? I did feel out body - or at least forgot about it 
"
"I seen an eye, purple pupil. I also seen a white tunnel, in which I was travelling through it. Big bright light at the end.

Millions of blue stars.
So beautiful."
"Sense of time - moving but yet staying still.
not aware of how my body was positioned.
sense of euphoria - being underwater
Deep purple - blocks of red, green cover the whole scene!
watery movements space moments - outer space - moving things - particles. Inspired / sense of birth
shifting shapes - evolving - sunrise - sense of being on a beach
Daisys - type of flower growing from my peripheral nose
sense of feeling child like
"
Light pinkish champaign colour when it was dark especially immediately after it had been bright I would see this purple fuzz that looked almost like a carpet or television static
"Experienced a pulsing mauve/violet orb which seemed to be moving away from me. As this pulsed the orb became bigger and closer.
The intense “Helicopter blade rotating” sound I experienced fractals like cracked ice/glass.
Also saw the pulse change from purple to cyan then to turquoise."
"
It felt like colours getting put on top of water surface & getting diffused, brighter. But my mind kept always rushing through the things to do. My back ache kept me from letting me go and relax.
"
"In a white tunnel, floating - 
Seen a tigers eye, very vivid.
Rolls of colour -
Loved the darkness -
Feeling of leaving body - whizzing forward."
"Moving patterns, shapes & pond like ripples of colour. 
Constant movement of warmer & cooler coluors too. 
Repeating patterns also and frequency too 
"
"Relaxing and slightly scary in parts. 
Feeling of going somewhere and coming back again.
Felt like deep unconsciousness."
"I felt reborn, womb, space travel, then back to the source (energy source) I then so lift as nothing and was floating. I was just energy and light. Utterly beautiful"
felt that it went by faster than I thought it would but think that was probably my perception of time rather than reality!
It was a very relaxing and enjoyable experience 
"A journey through rainbows and space and the natural world. I felt like I was flying through a colourspace in a new landscape at times. But as others I felt like I was somewhere in the ‘real’ world: a forest, the sea, waking up in a hospital bed.
I opened my eyes feeling alive + full of wonder and hope.
Thank you so much for this beautiful experience <3"
"I am not able to meditate easily. I found it hard to let go of thinking to start with.
Finally I forced myself to close my eyes and I started to see colours and shapes.
The most intensive colours were purple and neon green. I’ve seen green eye in the middle that was ‘......’ out into purple and black squares. After a while the colours changed into funnel type shapes wider on the outside and narrowing towards the middle. Moving constantly.
Interesting experience. I would like to try it again and maybe make myself more open to this experience from the very start."
"I found this a very pleasant and relaxing experience and was able to keep my eyes open for the event, it was a hypnotic experience and I moved with the colours and the music. The music changed with the colours and the tone matched the deepness of the colour. It felt like being watched by something that was looking out for me, watching over me with love and care. The music was amazing… and hopefully will stay with me… It felt like being in a room with Brian Eno and a Native Australian painter. "
"Mainly grid like shapes and separately. Spiralling sunbeam type patterns. Sometimes these two ‘vibes’ concealed into a tunnel like vision like an 80s sci-fi portal kind of thing, or what’s that fit where someone somehow enters a hard-drive? Like zooming between two flat plains of grids.
Sometimes it really resembled mosaic tiles. And also tall skyscrapers. There were also brief moments of something more organic and shiny. Like internal organs/tubes or hideous 70s gelatinous culinary creation. 
Sometimes central point like eye. "
"Lots of Kaleidoscope type scenes moving + changing. Popping, exploding. However, I was very tense. I felt that if I totally relaxed I would end up somewhere that I would not return (realisation of my issues lol)

Colours were beautiful, amazing to see but my eye kept leaking on the left. I loved the music (reminded me of Stranger things) "
"Major feeling was of calmness and peacefulness. Saw orbs of various colours interspersed with lighter coloured wavy lines.  
"
"A lot of time, I couldn’t let go. I was making lists in my head, planning my weekend. Evaluating my behaviour, criticising myself for not being in the moment and then back to making lists again. The beats for music and the rising and falling patterns were all that i had to focus on the experience.
But looking back, I can remember falling things based on the colours. 
I remember colours going from dawn to dusk, changing from orange, yellow, purple, indigo. These was a lot fo green, which made me think of large open fields and then a peach which reminded me of days we have nothing to do. All the change colours also made me think of that tool in MS paint whee you can choose a colours from a spectrum by moving a curse form left to right & up and down. "
"It reminded me of a child’s kaleidoscope toy, the shapes colours + patterns charged constantly. It also felt like lying in the sun with my eyes closed. It was mostly very colourful though there were black and white patterns. I was aware of my surroundings and heard the person next to me snoring. No computer could generate the patterns + colour combinations my mind created. It was an amazing experience. I thought I saw a baby, flowers, grubs. "
"It would be reasonable to just the experience for me was memories of my early times attempting to practice Raya yoga. 
And a very good image of being inside Brian Eno’s head."
"A series of brilliant geometric shapes. Magentas and blues mainly, occasional flashes of brilliant white. Greens and blues emerge softly on transition. Loss of concept of time. I may have fallen asleep. Occasionally I had to refocus on the shapes. Disappointed when it ended. Great patterns of intricate shapes.

When the lights faded a little was left with many repeating geographic shapes like Egyptian hieroglyphs.

Enjoyed experience - active but not alarming. Interesting what will come next."
"When the lights were dim and I opened my eyes and looked across the room at the people sitting opposite me I perceived that I was in a chamber taking me into the afterlife. 
I had a strong coffee about an hour before the experience so it took me about 10/15 minutes to relax into the experience but when I did relax it felt really relaxing. All my thoughts washed over me. Time seemed to take on a different dimension. "
"I feel deeply moved. I am very grateful to you all for creating and sharing such a beautiful idea, I had a powerful experience. I feel connected to us as a race, as sensitive, creative, imaginative and fragile animals. Thank you for making this, for ensuring it is accessible and that the space is held. If we all sat together through this I believe there would be more love in this world."
"saw a lot of shapes, sometimes converging into a single dot - like a tunnel on a track.
saw cogs of a wheel like shapes turning.
bright light and darkness light below and moving shapes above
Music when it went into dissonance affected the patterns I was seeing, like rain on water or just waves. Thought about riding a motor cycle a long a road. 
"
"I felt strange, empty of thought, unaware of time.
I saw lots of different colours with the flashing and brightness of the lights in sync with the rhythm and loudness of the music. "
"Overwhelmed! Crazy Patterns - geometric
Intense
Hexagons, orbs, diamonds
Moving Patterns
In another realm or universe 
Indescribable "
The serenity I felt afterward is unparalleled
So wonderfully colourful. A kaleidoscope of colours and feelings - Rich experience and want to repeat it again and again. Mesmeric and intense.
"I was trying so hard to relax and I felt like my worries kept coming and going. Although I did feel calmer when I came out, so something did change. I felt like I was trying to better understand myself in there. As the soundscapes get more intense I felt like I wasn’t in the space anymore. I was in another space drifting away. As if I was letting go of myself and trying to let go of my worries and outside life. 
I saw very colourful loops with black holes and felt my body at one paint one paint falling away or sinking feeling. The experience has made me feel more self aware of my mind + body and to generally relax. I have never had or felt this experience journey in Edinburgh, Scotland. "
"Time passed really quickly. Reds, oranges, yellows and in a diamond repeating pattern. And then the centre opened up. It was like being in a car and looking out to sea. And there was light at the end of the tunnel and this image repeated. Sometimes the centre of this looked as if there was an image of a person attempting to form and they kept ‘......’ around. But they were in a place of light and the colours came flowing towards it. 
The sound wasn’t as loud as might have thought but then I felt totally immersed in the whatever was going on. And the time passed so quickly. A very positive emotive warm experience. What did my mind tell me?? WHo knows - maybe I will know later. Impossible to explain."
"Mostly it was very calming and relaxing. I felt cozy and safe. The lights would build up a couple of times, it felt heavy/intense and I had to pull my mask down. In the beginning I could see browns, pinks and greens. I wanted to see more. I did. The colours, shapes and patterns changed. Vibrant reds, blues, sometimes black with green, moments of golden peace. Patterns collapsed in on each other over and over. It was beautiful and I wished I could stay longer. The guy beside me fell asleep and started snoring. It’s a lot to remember, hard to remember, its all hard to explain or express it. Love Jon Hopkins music. Really made the experience and complimented the visuals building up the intensity of the experience. It made me sad in a good way."

"Alternating, binary, tessellated patterns however distorted with pincushion/barrel distortions which remind me of M.C.Escher patterns. Superimposed upon the tessellations were Fine patterns like symbols either pictographic or hieroglyphic.

Associations: M.C.Escher,
Fractals, interference patterns,
Speckles, star-radiating patterns.
Awe inspiring! "
"Deep vibrant orange blanket of colour.
Pink hues mixed with blocks + triangles of colour.
Spectrum of colour in a circular shape - ‘......’ in distant point.
Green, blue, grey mist almost like rain.

I recently lost my Mum (in May), it felt very emotional - but only towards the end. Almost an explanation was potentially offered as to where Mum’s soul may be now, or perhaps I was searching for it - but a spiritual experience. A sense of continuity, possibility + ‘......’.
Death + life: The universe."
"Very universey
Earthy
Watery
Loads of motion
Peaceful"
"At times I felt heat while being aware that the temperature was not changing.
Pixels of colours moving randomly.
At times I could see faces + outlines of bodies.
It was a very pleasant + relaxing experience while being like an attack on the senses. "
"I don’t remember as much of it as I would have expected to!
Most of the thoughts/images were quite fleeting and changed quickly.
At the beginning the images stemmed mostly from the centre and became more vivid gradually. 
The bright, orange/yellow light I saw was very intense and reminded me of being on the beach. A lot of the patterns conjured memories.
Other images were more like geometric shapes and patterns. 
I feel quite drained now, but in a nice, relaxed way."
"A waterfall of colours and pulsating lights seeming to draw me forwards almost like being pulled into space. Then a reset of plain light - Mostly orange then red before the pulsing and flashing began again - waves of experience.
Each time after a colour ‘reset’ the shape of the pulses and the frequency was different. A huge variety of colours - light/dark."
"I saw turquoise/blue lights spiralling quite a lot. This turned into a persons body (black) crouching down on one knee with its head down with the blue specks on it.
This turned into a spiral again which was orange/red and had faces on it as it moved - a bit concerned lol.
The blue came back and looked like a spiral galaxy plain moving around (blue+black).
It then turned orange again which reminded me of the womb and there was a comforting feeling."
"Space + Time dissolved. There was incredible beauty when it felt like the lights went dark, subtle yet undeniable sacred geometry. The best moments in the spaces, beyond the illusion………
Sparkly!! Floaty!!"
"At first it felt really relaxed and deep breathing, it was very interesting at first. Once trial part was finished I knew what to expect, I enjoyed it more.
I did feel overwhelmed with the patterns and movement, didn’t know if my eyes were open or closed.
I felt sad, emotional, happy, warm, floating, and falling.
Wonderful experience.
Definitely felt very relaxed but also emotional. I felt almost lighter after."
"I experienced a feeling of warmth + deep relaxation. I saw mostly pink, red + peach colours. This reminded me of a desert - warm, empty, peaceful + calm. Time went in very quickly. It was a good experience. "
"Trepidation as main white light came up. Then red scape. Most of the presentation was around the centre point and radiating out on vertical and horizontal axis. At one point electric blue and green dots were visualised, then ‘waves’ travelling from outside to in and horizontal to vertical axis at same time.
As music ‘stuttered’ then ‘ripples’ seemed to travel across the eyescape."
"Checkerboard tunnel of interchanging colours, moving at speed towards the centre.
Lots of reds, yellows, electric blues.
Cuboid geometric shapes, almost 3 dimensional.
At one point there were figures in my periphery that looked human marching towards the centre. I could never quite see them, they remained out of focus.  "
"I saw a lot of geometric shapes that moved. It reminded me of a kaleidoscope. As it went on my heart was beating quite fast so it felt quite overwhelming. It also looked a bit like light filtering through water and at another point it reminded me of stars in space. I mostly saw red, navy and orange. But at times saw turquoise and pink in the red and navy."
"I felt my heart beat slow, and the pulse in the neck become loud, I became more aware of my body sitting in the chair looking at my restful body."
"It started gently - a bath of pink light, fizzing and sparkling like glitter floating in pink water. As it intensified it became multicoloured tessellated hexagons with the borders of each fizzing lights. When I moved my eyes from side to side it would change colour and shape, I could travel down the tunnels in the centre, with the light and shapes flying past. At the end it became gentle again like soft pink glittery clouds, undulating over each other. A great experience."
"Stress + anxious
Dizzy
Out of control

"Relaxed

Confusing
Sceptical "
"Many colours twisting + weaving into each other, lots of swirls and blackhole (?) looking shapes, sucking the patterns into it. White stars/cats eyes from the sides spinning into each other. Big eyeballs twisting + looking around. Comforting, being watched over, not stared at."
"At first only colourful lights and figures, then they were mixed with real and fictional experiences intermingled with the lights and colours.
The experience was out of body like while feeling as inwards in myself as possible. Gard to describe, wonderful though. Very relaxed once I was out. "
"Is a dream-like experience where light, sounds and sensations get all mixed together. Right now, I don’t really know if I did the experience awake or asleep. I feel relaxed and tranquil. Sometimes I see stars, actually a kind of space like which when I close my eyes, the actual experience was like this but x1000."
"Beautiful colours, patterns moving in my mind, relaxation like sleep but aware, the universe? Myself? Sometimes intense movements of the patterns. Wanted it to last forever. Difficult to explain in words but a beautiful experience."
Many colours - patterns constantly glowing and changing shapes/directions.
I’m not entirely sure! A trippy trippy light show I don’t have the vocabulary to describe!!
"A vortex, being pulled into a vortex and travelling at really high speeds. The colours were always block colours. Calming colours - intense red, 
Cool blue
Lilac.
Green.
It felt safe, everything will be okay. I centred and everything went black and then a new colour formed and the process began again."
"The experience felt like I was waking up in the morning and experiencing everything I would have during the day. Thoughts would randomly enter my mind and would soon fade away with different transitions of lights and sounds. The patterns would change direction, colour and shape. Almost like just waking up from a dream."
"An array of geometric shapes and patterns mainly in blue, red and yellow.
Feeling of drifting in and out of consciousness."
"Unexpected, calming but dynamic. Lots of red, yellow, green and blue. Favourite part was the walk through the forest and being at the bottom of the ocean. 
Time did not exist.
Awesome! 
Thank you."
"I couldn’t tell if my eyes were open or not and following through a solar system of lights I was worried if my eyes had opened and I’d lose the flow but slowly through the phases of solar, dune, dappled canopy, relaxation came and where I was disappeared for longer and longer spaces. Not that I forget, just that it wasn’t important.
It could be loosely formed and controlled but only like oil on water in cupped hands can be controlled and shaped. While focusing on the foreground the background would gently have changed and my little forms would melt into the nights sky of worlds I have never seen before. Travelling at speed or slow close or far there was not a gap in it, just tides. I wish it could have lasted forever, I wish I could have been able to move, to dance after but not is not a failing, only a facet."
"I felt very relaxed, as if I was watching a light show, where patterns and colours became more intense as the time progressed. It reminded me of a kaleidoscope. At times I felt I saw places/things I had seen before or been to before."
Surreal.
"It changed as I went through the experience. Like being in the womb, like dying must feel like. It also reminded me of swimming in the sea and not being able to see what’s happening in the sea. The plant life and the sea insects. Parts of it reminded me of the scene in gladiator with the wheat. It also reminded me of taking MDMA and going to shine! "
"Lots of red and blues, at times yellow. One point I felt a little stressed but then it calmed down and I felt relief. Felt I saw the start and end of life. Kaleidoscope effect. The music helped guide the light. At times I saw the pi symbol and snowflakes and other patterns and symbols. "
"Felt very uneasy initially and at points throughout. If I went back again I could relax more but I was wary of strangers or what I’d experience. I was also worried in case I was transported to another dimension and couldn’t get back. The yellow light was comforting. I found myself trying to control the speed of the images. I was able to relax more towards the end with calmer, lighter music. I felt connected to the universe and everything was connected and going in circles. I felt like I would see this when I died and I felt like I’d seen it before."
"Sincerely I was asleep all the time. I cannot remember anything.
At the beginning I felt so relaxing and comfortable but this moment took not too much time."
"Loads of coloured lights, faces, figures in long space. Lights strobing from wide to a point very intense."
I also got lots of visions of nature. Lavender fields the most prominent.
"Coloured lights - that at times soothed, at one times very intense. 
Vibrant - red, greens, pinks, sunny vibes."
"A kaleidoscope through space, floating. "
I felt relaxed and calm. I had moments of my life with my children run in front of my eyes. I slept towards the end of the session. 
A kaleidoscope with moving patterns and images and lots of colours. There was things moving both sides and then it felt like was rotating and moving towards what looked like a eye shape in the distance.
"I saw kaleidoscopic shapes in every colour of the rainbow and at times saw human figures/animal figures. I saw storms, volcanoes, lightning, fields of sheep, space + stars, as well as water + beaches."
"An out of body experience with surround sound, flashing visuals, colours, lights and patterns all created and individual to each person. "
"A lot of colour, moving blue and purple dots and shapes
Red water
Warm washes of solid colour
Eyes
Bright intense light
Two little girls"
"Plenty of vibrant colours and shapes.
Relaxing.
Reflective.
Peaceful."
So many racing though I would come back to my brain and allow myself to sink into the experience again. There was a point I felt a sense of awareness and it was just pleasant and also quite neutral. I just feel glad to have awareness.  
"There was a feeling of as if I was moving through this alternative space while it too was moving. Both go us moving, evolving. My emotions were calming. I experienced pensiveness and warm when there where helicopter-like sounds and a dread feeling but it wasn’t so intense. There was a warmth in my heart space and it was like it vibrated outward through my body. I would move my head up as if I was trying to follow this great thing. I felt peace and a lot of love for this alternate space/reality. I felt playful, like a child. There was point I felt as if it were a combination of autumn and spring, as it had stopped raining and there was a warm soft orange and a feeling of things being cleared. The orange reminded me of autumn leaves while the brightness and light, pleasant music reminded me of spring. I wish it was longer ( the experience) I noticed myself with racing thoughts of my ‘world’ my ‘real world’. and I feel like I was losing out of the experience. "
"I saw some changed in colour from blue to orange to white but felt like the experience more as a relaxing meditation. I felt most relaxed when in the dark which surprised me as I usually don’t like pitch darkness when trying to sleep. I felt immersed in the music and mostly found it relaxing but there was one high-temp part which made me feel more tense. 
I sat up during the experience rather than lying back as I didn’t find that comfortable but noticed my body was moving back and forwards and around as if oscillating at some points - I’ve been told that I have moved in similar patterns during reiki and meditation session I’ve had in the past. I enjoyed the experience. "
"Something that struck me was the sensation of movement, Sometimes I thought I was flying completely on my back on the ceiling, sometimes I thought I was upright + laying straight. I also had a good sense of being able to control who I was seeing which was intense. I alternate between drifting my thoughts . — 

"
"warmth from the sun soothing my body 
yellow calming my surroundings 
Blue wakening up my awareness like a cool blue clear sky
Purple washing quiet sadness over me
Sound reverberating through my body, its waves rising + filling, energising + relaxing. 
Green waking me up gently, like spring meadow. 
Black like a warm, comforting dusk room, cosy + looked after in bed. "
"I saw the colours of the rainbows. I felt I was in a different dimension, don’t know where I was, but it was nice & good. It was such a surreal experience. "
"A wonderfully relaxing experience where it felt amazing to be led by the lights and sounds. Some of the most vivid colours. At one point towards the end, the back of my head felt like it was moving against the seat !
I can’t remember a lot of the shapes but found myself in tunnels a lot both going forwards and backwards. I want to come back."
I saw a lot of orange at first then more vivid shades of blue zig zag and a very bright light in the centre with white grid like patterns around. I also couldn’t tell you how long the experience took! 
"Real variety, real energy, real peace all incredibly vivid. Geometric shapes flyying out toward me, with reptitiion of reds but many colours - green in the quiet periods. Intense, peaceful & amazing experience. Thanks. "
"It felt cool. At times early in the experience, it felt like I could manipulate the shapes into different objects. An eye morphed into a twisting dragon like being, before changing into a sea of skyscrapers. Awesome :)
It was incredibly relaxing to the point where I fell asleep. When I woke it didn’t feel as if i’d been fast asleep, just in a light nap. It was completely unique. Maybe the best nap of my life. Thanks :) "
"Throbbing, pulsing shapes, usually red merging into blues and blacks and yellows. They swelled and moved with the music. The calm between the pulses swirled with blues and the odd flush of purple. 
The beginning was intense and a little jarring. It felt like I had to try to keep my eyes closed and I was drawn to see the light. As I settling into it I faded in and out of the shapes, at time having to focus on vision. I felt like I could sometimes control the movement of shapes - in and out and how quickly or slow, as my mind moved with the music. Towards the end my body felt incredibly heavy and cal, like I was lying under a thick weighted blanket. I could have drifted off to sleep (like the snoring man). "
"Please, please, please argue for the therapeutic benefits of this. Use the equipment to show the decision-makers what ever a short, one of session can do for a mind, a body and a soul and give the future of humanity some hope. Thank you for creating this Dreamachine and for allowing me and hundred if not thousands, of other to experience it. You will have changed lives, don’t ever doubt that. You could change countless more. Should you find a way to miniature rise and make more portable or home friendly this apparatus, I’m in. Eternal gratitude and best wishes. "
"Still just wow! Second time around, and still amazing. Tunnels of light leading to cavernous deep space, densely packed with stars, with occasional dips into the warmest, bluest oceans, surrounded by bubbles, all the while feeling like I’m in the only nightclub i’d ever want to be in again. Not long before entering this session today, I was informed of the sudden death of an old distant friend. During this session I hoped that she felt something akin to this as she passed through to whoever out spirits go when the body is of no further use to us, because on this experience our brains, or more specifically out consciousness has too much going on just to end. "
"The taster began with bright yellow ( felt like being in a desert) then moved to red. Then the honeycomb came in such intense colours with a black hole in the middle that things moved into. The main event: started sepia, then yellow, then honeycomb, more kalidescope spinning, as the music intensified the kalidecope moved in layers, some to the left and some to the right. Occasionally, I saw kaleidoscope in the middle and split down the sides.  "
"Taster: sunlight, made me feel warm. honeycomb - blues, purples yellow
Main: Sunlight at the beginning + felt heat felt in an auditorium, shapes/bodies in the seats. Orange and blue at that point. 
Felt like dry ice coming and opened my eyes - looked like dry ice but no smell. Felt v relaxed. Thought about sleeping but didn’t. Felt like my Reiki had switched on. "
There was a front space and behind space that had different patterns and shapes. When the bass increased in the music the background space spun and vibrated faster. In the centre was a red cross tinged with blue. It made me feel relaxed and weirdly nostalgic. Toward the end when the colours died down I started thinking about my childhood home and the memory of my dad putting me into bed carrying me. 
"The surface of a psychedelic experience minus the emotional/spiritual/intellectual breakthrough/ revolution 
A beautiful, relaxing but ultimately empty experience compared to LSD or mushrooms. "
"saw: moving kaleidoscope of many colours. constantly changing + morphing into a rainbow. Tiny bit like 1970s opening sequence of Dr Who.
 
think: felt relaxed + then fell asleep very quickly. Would wake intermittently, to the kaleidoscope. Think I was asleep 70% of the time.

feel: slight panic initially at the lights but settled quickly.

saw: At one point it went black + was like “graph paper” Black background with white lines forming boxes. Then a 3D ball appeared on the centre in black most of the time I saw colours. "
"At first I was quite anxious, almost to the point where I almost left, but as the experience started I realised that it was lights and my mind - in summary it was amazing a totally mad experience! The visuals where amazing, psychotic prisms and colours and stars, one point I felt I was going through a vortex. I realised though as I began to think of the outside world I couldn’t. Amazing <3 "
Scattered colours in infinite space. Love and harmony with the universe. All thing that mattered appeared in concrete form within the mind. Externally I just like looking at the pretty colours. Transported into a kaleidoscope. 
There were points where I’d see lots of vivid colours before it went to bright yellow & then black & white/grayscale. At some points when it was most intense I’d see a teal green light coming out of a vivid orange background that then because a pulsating grid of teal & orange & I felt like I was falling backwards down a hole. 
"Saw creation of the sun, feel warmth - until your toes tell you they aren’t in the sun so your not sun bathing. 
Feel the swooping vastness of space, switch to already known visuals - hyperspace/movies/games.
Music prompts change in visuals, engine sounds - spinning increases, blades of helicopters/ plane propellers/ boats.
Waves - stone into a panel, wripples
What I am trying ti switch between known patterns & new visuals I don’t recognise. "
"I felt that there was a full universe space in my mind. Although my eyes were shut, they were more than open. I saw at first like a kaleidoscope & the most beautifully intense colours I have ever scene blend beautifully although also contrasting sharply. at one point the patterns left me & although I was aware I was awake my mind wondered to other places thinking randomly about the world & my place in it. near the end i could see a gold like flock & bird dancing infront of me Im not sure what I was thinking but I enjoyed their intense colour & movement. I do not feel like speaking presently but feel a calm inner peace that I am not ready to leave behind. "
"Visuals kept on evolving in tune with the music and intensity of the lights.
There was often a geometrical component (helix, hexagon and squares, circles) and colours could change depending on the light and music pattern, keeping similar shapes/pattern until the rhythm changed again. 
I found that if I tried to focus on how to describe what I was seeing, I’d almost drift off and several seconds of the experience went , until I focused on the light and music again.
It was very pleasant, with colours & love - Bright orange, warm blue, purples - with a few black/white patterns.
When the music was pulsating upbeat, thin white geometric figures would overlay and more with bigger coloured patterns underneath. I loved the variability of the experience and colours, lights and music really really moved together. 

"
"Initially it was broad colours like Rothko paintings. Then as the music intensified it was more fractal geormetic shapes similar to a kaleidoscope. Then slowly limbs would flash up, a knee, an arm, but drawn in anime kind of way. Then there was a sense of movement of pupulsion towards the centre of something. Like I was being drawn towards the core of the universe. The colours changed at that point from perdominatly blue to greens and yellow. Then slowly it went back to the rothko paintings."
"kaleidoscope patterns calming neutral colours, then bright intense colours chaotic 
could feel figured moving close to me 
very watery & reflective but also clouds and floaty "
"I felt I’m free to play and its like a deep thought around me!
I never saw this before its sound, colour, feel inside me!
Experienced never before! I think it’s connected with my inner childhood."
"I felt like I was in a colour blindness test and I sail couldn’t see the number. A windows media player visualiser. An interior landscape that I was and wasn’t in control of. Constantly on the bring of waking, a reflection always out of reach. Is this plane inside moor outside, a breakdown of interior and exterior. ‘A sunrise’ but no sun rising. An inexplicable experience of abstract contradiction. frequently approaching the world of heaven in a playing. I don’t know the name of but in menacing traffic light colours"
There is something beyond. Just out of reach.
I had trouble distinguishing what I was imaginging from what I was actually “seeing”
"lots of patterns + colours, mostly in grid formation becoming more or less intense as the light changed - like a early 90’s rave photo
_I also felt movement & tension in my face or head 
– 
"
"I saw bursts of colour. Mostly warm tones of orange and yellow. Green tried to burst in bust was always overpowered by the yellow. A form of life sometimes floated through the colours. Shapes were very visible such as geometric shapes, flowery objects fences. 
I kept feeling like I was drifting in and out of consciousness but it was very relaxing. Probably the most relaxed I’ve ever been in my life. Feeling pretty mellow. 
I saw a visual of a person driving into the ocean from a nice sunny place. the man diced too deep. He startled scrambling, to get back out. At that moment the visual stopped. 
"
"I went on a journey. Time travel like, through space, solar systems and galaxies. Then arrived at earth and moved through the continents. First experiencing the desert, then the Artic/Antarctica.
I felt calm. Relaxed, Tingley. Removed from reality. "
I saw a range of different kaleidoscope patterns which faded in an out of each other. Every so often the clearest image was a red/ white/black “x” in the centre with a sort of hatched pattern around the sides. I also had a sense of moving at high speed through a space through a moving flexible tube. My body felt heavy like I was being pressed into the seat and when the piano sound was playing at the end I could feel a twinge in my leg each time a certain high note was played as if it was the key being pressed. 
"Felt like I was running away very fast, past trees with the sunshine beating through. As the msic got faster, I ran faster. I felt very energetic as if I was going to explode, but when I listened to my heart it was very slow. Strange sensation as im used to feeling very anxious where my head and heart are born racing. Only my mind and thoughts were racing this time. 
Also thought ‘this must be what it’s like when you die’ when it was very bright and felt like my whole world was flying past me. Finally felt like I could see lots of red flashing lights and started thinking of bad things like fire and danger. Ended with the music slowing down and feeling more relaxed again.
"
"Visually it reminded me of experiences using plant medicine, but in a lot less intense way. At times it felt like a sort of lucid dream state, just in the space between consciousness and unconsciousness. The music had an influence on the pattern that I saw being created. I feel very relaxed coming out, and at times it felt like being in a deep meditation. As I write this I am becoming aware that I have no idea how long it lasted, it seemed not that long of a time, a feeling I have experienced in meditation or things such as sound baths."
"Made me Grin!
So many colours 
And shapes like Persian tiles
And warmth 
Wonderful 

Geomrtry surprised me - 
I experienced organic shapes
But not straight lines 
"
"I felt some anxiety and tried to block out what was happening at the beginning. As it went on I went with it more, enjoying the kaleidoscope type shapes, colours and waves. 
I saw many colours, water-like ripples, snowflake like shapes, clours and ice. 
The music had a powerful effect on what I saw & the pulse, beat and range created different visuals. We all benefit from experiences that open up our minds. "
"Intensely relaxing - despite the manic colours and patterns behind my eyes at times, sometimes verging on too intense but yet addictive! The most amazing rainbow colours, I saw lots of cube pattern shapes too - visually in 2 sets of colours. "
There was times when it just seemed like a sunny day and was calm and still. Then other times there were circles of blues and purples that changed size and moved around. There were hexagon type shapes with a figure in the middle that appeared when I tried to concentrate hard on it. I felt really relaxed throughout it and feel like I may have been falling asleep. I saw random things and remembered conversations for split seconds the refocused on the music and saw lots of different shapes and colours. I remember seeing a petal shape sort of flower and how it was really deep light blue/green/purple colours. There was lots of deep red and bright orange colours too. I felt like I saw a figure in the centre of a hexagon with orange hair and a green top on. 
"I saw my ovn version of peace. At the beginning a white/peach colour that felt and looked so pure and naked. It then moved on to a lot of beautiful shapes, visuals, artworj, perfectly at one with the music. It made me feel like everything is good?
No that’s not what I mean… just as if I was having a moment of peace, of beauty of calm. Of wonder. I feel like I am connected to someting bigger. I’ve belived this for a long time - and this experience reinforced this. It made me feel connected to the universe. 
"
"At first blue, green light without detail, resolving itself into geometric patterns. As the experience developed and the music became more intense, the colours became brighter - other remaining a really intense orange + yellow for periods - without detail. Then faded to pink + light blue, then darkness. My favourite part of the experience was the gentle colours - with very subtle, small patterns."
"This was the second time at dream machine for me and the main difference was that this time - I have found it a bit less intense and less overwhelming and my first time I don’t know whether it’s because I knew what to expect because of some difficulties and worries I am going through in this period I also saw more geometric patterns this time, and less colours."
"Felt kaleidoscopic at the beginning, but then colours seemed to blend, creating a smoothness. There were periods of intense sunlight, it felt like a lovely calm (and warm) sunny day. There were moments that rigid, almost digital patterns flipped and became like pop-art for a fleeting moment. At the peak of the crescendo I felt extremely calm, almost not even aware of myself at all. As the ‘......’ in the music circulated and slowed down the visuals became almost like fabric."
"
I felt like I was flying fast through space
Lots of fractals + geometric patterns.
"
"At first I was a bit anxious, but the breathing exercises at the start helped. I felt very relaxed and really enjoyed the patterns and colours I experienced. I felt there was a prominent pattern during times, with a pattern in the background I could sort of make out - which I interpreted as a blockage maybe?"
"I saw a series of kaleidoscopes like images. The more flashes there were the faster the shapes moved. The colours, shapes and movements changed often. There was a split second I thought I was floating. "
"A vast array of colours and different shades of red, green, blue, yellow, orange. I saw many shapes (circles, hexagons, ovals). I saw dotted lines, split lines, explosions of colour. It made me feel relaxed and powerful. I reflected and fell at ease. When the lights dimmed, blue and red were the most prominent colours I saw. At times, I felt like I was floating through the universe like I was in the centre of a galaxy surrounded by thousands of stars. "
Lots of eyes
"
We can become incredibly resilient, if we just remain aware. 
"
"Beautiful calming experience. I feel empowered in the world, in our world. I feel grateful. 
I saw different colours coming towards me and lost sense of time. I feel happy.
"
"I don’t even know where to start! That was an increidble experience! Range of emotions experienced, including pure joy, euphoria + total peace!
At one point, I felt as though I was being projected through space, flying forward through the cosmos with amazing light.
Can’t believe it is just white light!
At one point I was going to sick with the intensity or emotion. Thank you.
"
A real sense of comfort/protection/safety. Being held by something more powerful than me (mother?) felt on the edge of something profound. There’s more stuff to this than we know/ Imagination + ____ = self awareness!!
"This is like I’m observing from an outside point of view, I’m seeing the lifetime of a person, or a world, how it’s born, raised, how it grows, thrives, sacrifices, marching towards the ultimate goal, to which it’s willing to dedicate all it has got. To which it marches and marches till itself has to be dissolved into the end. Leaving nothing but ceaseless echoes, further and further away but sinking, touching my heart more and more. Then fortunately, it’s reborn, its lively energy is forever continued and inherited, constituting part of the beautiful world.
As for myself, I found this wall or shell inside of me, which kept my emotions/feelings from uniting with the sounds/music that’s calling on it. I tried to defeat this force, to destruct this obstacle with stronger emotions, but it’s useless. I gradually felt dry inside. Then I lost track of this thought. When I regained consciousness I surprisingly found the wall disappeared, ‘......’ into part of my own emotions, my heart ‘......’."
My hands were very tingly the whole time. They felt like they might fall off. 
Lots of colours shapes and flashing patterns. I felt relaxed but not at all times as sometimes the music was high pitched and loud and meditiatve at times. 
"I saw kaleidoscope colours and shapes, tunnels, swirls fashion and pulsing. The colours and shapes changed direction, moved around the space, defying expectation. Similar to ‘Interstellar’ and ‘2001: a space odyssey’. The most vivid red I’ve ever seen. 
Emotional, profound sense of wellness and peace and acceptance, a spiritual experience. Thoughts of hoping this what it’s like when I die. 
Toward the end I saw people looking out from a cave as if I was in the cave behind them. I saw a door. A big eye that evolved into a sphere. "
"Nostalgia + ‘......’ got the tension and foresight of life itself. One can’t help but go on a journey of one’s self, what we’ve experienced, what we’ve lost and gained. The life not yet known. The life not yet experienced. The life one perhaps even wonders what may come to be. ‘......’ the wondering that comes as the simplicity of a day and night ebbs and flows. The anticipation of life itself gives one confidence as to the adventure that the life we’re given truly is.
Carpe Diem."
"I saw pulsing geometric patterns and shapes, sometimes strong fiery colours, sometimes more gentle subtle colours. 
Sometimes rotating patterned details around a strong central shape, sometimes all over regular patterns, visually in repetitive tile shapes. I felt completely relaxed and transported to another place. The music felt like it washed over me and perhaps helped my mind to sail away. A creaky floorboard at the end snapped me out of my relaxed state, I had forgotten where I was completely. 
"
"What I saw changed during the experience. Most of the time there was a central focal point, like an eye or oval, during my yoga breathwork and meditation we use the 3rd eye as a focal point so maybe this has something to do with it. Most of the time I felt calm seeing mostly blue and red colours + patterns, as if inside a kaleidoscope and other times I saw just plain orange as if I was sitting on the beach enjoying the sun. At one point I imagined the noise of a helicopter and war, this was the only time I didn’t feel calm (towards the end of the experience)."
"Gorgeous, profound deep experience which initially move me to tears it was so beautiful. An enormous sense of peace and wonder, at the gigantic space “…………”  which was infinite and constantly changing. 
There were changes of pace and things sped up coinciding accordingly to the speed of the lights and soundscape. 
At the end I became almost weightless and was trying to fly above out of my body but felt like I was out of time. I could quite lift off but was nearly there. "
"This was a comfortable relationship with sound and lights. A fusion of colour embedded into the void. This was not a totally new experience. I am a sound healer and ‘......’ and I work with eco-soma in ‘......’.
This is a tool which I believe can open up the mind and release negative patterns in thinking. 
Jon Hopkins' music was powerfully beautiful.
Breathwork and shamanism work easily with me personally. Thankful I found that I easily merged into the Dreamachine experience. 
Once the music flattened after a crescendo!! There was a rebirthing - a new era conception in the void."
"intense feel of ‘excitement’ or awe, I am not sure hot to describe it - maybe more accurately, it felt like the moment before something awesome happens - the moment before you kiss someone for the first time, perhaps. This did not exclude a comfort feeling of relaxation and safety, that was always present through the experience. It felt like, at some point, my eyes were empty. My eyes were just cavities filled in my lights and shapes, colours, ‘……..’ (delete)"
"Fascinating experience.
Amazing shapes.
Felt as if I was travelling in outer space. Relaxing. rewarding .
Felt myself falling asleep once or twice.
Comfortable. Warming.
Occasionally the lights seemed a little harsh and I had to squeeze my eyelids tighter.
Held my wife’s hand, which added to the feeling of comfort."
"Relaxed, Psychedelic, Fun"
"I saw an intense, flowing orange light filling the whole space. I then saw a vortex of orange and blue. It moved like water. Shapes and colours followed after that but —--- struck me most; at some point I saw blue and red in dots at a point, but the rest of the vision was black and white or grey, —------------- and there were shaped I could remember but square like. They stoof like curtains while red and blue were moving. I also saw some fuchsia, and spots of violet. The prevelent colours for me were orange and amber, that would fill the vision and by looking into them more closely I saw ‘veins’  of light, that moved similarly to water. When orange and amber were present I felt at times intense feel of ‘excitement’ or awe, I am not sure hot to describe it - maybe more accurately, it felt like the moment before something awesome happens - the moment before you kiss someone for the first time, perhaps. This did not exclude a comfort feeling of relaxation and safety, that was always present through the experience. It felt like, at some point, my eyes were empty. My eyes were just cavities filled in my lights and shapes, colours, ‘……..’
"
"The experience was quite intense at times, I felt like I was ‘.......’ ‘......’ to motion focus + occasionally felt like I was disconnected from my thoughts. I didn’t see any specific images, things that I could recognise but I saw a variety of different shapes + colours sometimes very intensely."
"Kept getting recurring red diagonal lines through almost every image. At every stage it signalled a transition to a new thought. I returned to a previous job, making emotions come to the front again. Only issue that made no sense was I was a lion in the middle of a huge open space. There were no plants, trees, water or anything else. I’m thinking it may be me on my own or other symbolism."
"Apprehensive lots of colours like tripping colours and shapes. Then went with it.
Like flying through space.
Out of body.
Then followed a flow of ‘......’ going down a hole then it was like I was under water. Swimming underwater with the sea above. Then back to earth."
"I couldn’t draw what I saw. 
I saw deep colours that I didn’t see before.

I saw my wife standing over me with a knife + blood."
"I felt relaxed but so tenseness in my forehead.
Felt I was on a sunny beach. I saw beautiful purple flowers like an orchid.
I saw hexagons in red."
"My body was very relaxed and heavy, similar to how your body feels during hypnosis.
At times it felt overwhelming but then the lights and patterns would change and my body would relax again.
I feel almost refreshed and peaceful.
It’s indescribable and so personal to each experience."
"The brightest, most intense colours - pure and difficult to replicate in design. A gentle smile throughout.
It felt like each individual cone in my retina was being activated to its full potential."
"Crazy but in a good way, the sensation was of positivity but at some points negativity would try and take over and the positivity would win."
"Vivid flashing lights, kaleidoscopic effect.
Tunnels
Extremely bright lights
Felt it was too short
Strange feeling of brightness with closed eyes. "
"I was aware that I was thinking. A bit like when you try to meditate and your mind keeps going back to your to do list. Lots and lots of colours and patterns like a fast moving kaleidoscope. Intense warm colours like lying in the sunshine and moving vibrant patterns. Sometimes the patterns felt very intense and I was feeling like I couldn’t take it anymore and then I felt relief when it was still and dark again.
The whole thing was quite intense. I would like to do it again. "
"Intense, sometimes overwhelming but very enjoyable. My mind was constantly trying more to process the shapes and colours I was seeing and trying to recognise images. I saw numbers and random things like a butterfly when the music was calm. When the music was intense the visuals got very quick and random. "
"I felt movement under the eyes, glorious flashing and flickering. Created a sense of lucid dreaming indicating movement whereas there was none, instead there was different levels of lighting. Firstly the focus was on the movement behind the eye lids. Then the mind was found drifting off away into a thoughtless, lost state. It ended and I felt more time had gone by than it had. Felt almost like I had a whole night sleep, when in reality it was around 20 mins. Very enjoyable and relaxing. Will definitely try again. "
"I was eased into a sense of peace and calm. A feeling of serenity, meditative calmness. With eyes fluttering like crazy and millions of interesting and very colourful patterns emerged and vanished. Colours of all hues from deep blue with green margins to cream with red/maroon. Almost like I was witnessing a kaleidoscope with my eyes shut or wide open!! The patterns and colours were just brilliant, something which I have never experienced before. At the same time, I realised that there was a smile on my face. Also I thought about my family members living and dead and thought about the bus ticket I need to book from Belfast to Dublin but was not able to due to some issues with my credit card. 
Overall an exhilarating and brilliant experience."
"Purple
Dots
Shapes - getting smaller - bigger
Was short
Not as long or as bright as I had anticipated -
Maybe a good thing!
Made me think of one person in particular??
Tunnel at one stage."
"In the initial stage I saw, as the light brightened, a mostly peach/cream sort of sunset melange colour but as the light began to flash it seemed to organise itself into a grid of mostly Red and light blue light. As the lights pulsed and faded, I noticed the grid gave way to a myriad of fading light. Swirls mostly green and blue undulating and changing constantly, almost like observing a liquid magnetic field in motion, fantastic!"
I saw lots of colours and they were flashing and it looked a bit like a kaleidoscope. Flashy shapes and wavy. It kept moving away and I was focusing on it because I liked watching it. Sometimes it went blue and was kind of how I would imagine space. Sometimes I saw figures kind of dancing and moulding together like cartoon people. 
"Kind of like looking through a broken stained glass window, that moved and changed inward and outward. Reminded me of the end scene of 2001: Space Odyssey where the astronaut is pulled through. “My god, it’s full of stars!” From the Space Odyssey book. "
"So many colours from warm reds, orange, pinks to green, blue, purple. A range of spots and shapes. Large then small. I seen myself at one point. Felt relaxed but then edgy. Warm feeling, some feeling of searching for something. Intrigued and grounded were main feelings. Amazed at how different the images were and rapidly changed. I felt like I could drift off to sleep quite easily. More rounded and curved lines and images. No real straight lines. No sharp edges or squares. Floating feeling and floating shapes. "
"I felt adventure. Full of wonder, resistance, anticipation, anxiety, fear and resolution, play. "
"Felt relaxed and in a meditative state.
Seen rainbows of different colours and shapes, which were all interconnected to the ‘eye’ in the middle.
Certain noises such as noise at start made me feel like I was back in a different time. "
"I really enjoyed the experience I would like to give it another go it could of been longer. 
The experience itself is hard to explain. The brighter the light got the warmer I felt plus my eyes water with the bright light almost felt like looking at the sun on a warm day. I was so relaxed at times I felt like I was spinning almost like being on a rollercoaster at the start. It felt like I was looking through a kaleidoscope."
"Lots of different colours and patterns flashing into different shapes.
Was almost space like in certain parts was kind of like a galaxy moving. "
The experience started off with a bright light followed by an orange glow with yellow (almost nerve like) patterns. It’s so hard to describe but the best I can do is say there was lots of fractals. The shapes kept changing with the music I saw a lot of rainbow patterns (I don’t know if this was the I had been to pride a few days before or it was just what my mind made?) I also felt a spiritual experience where I thought about existence. And what it means to be human?
"I felt like travelling to another dimension. The road trip to the other dimension. It was an amazing experience. A constant sensation of travelling. Very enjoyable. Completely detached from the outside world. Felt refreshed and relaxed after. Feel quite impressed by the machine and the visual art my eyes created. 
Thank you."
"I felt relaxed and an overwhelming sense of peacefulness. The music with the visual effects were soothing and transcended me to a place that was not in the dream pod. 
I’m still so amazed that the intricate patterns and colours were created by only white light and that my unconscious brain has the power to see imagery that I struggle to imagine now. The experience is very difficult to describe and try to recreate the visuals with chalks + paper is nearly impossible, it was very powerful and I feel it is something everyone should try and experience. I leave feeling at peace and intuned with my mind."
I saw organised changing grid patterns. Colours varied but a lot of blue variations + gold. I got a sense of new beginnings. At the beginning I felt panic but then it subsided and I felt safe. 
"Geometric patterns, repetitive colours, blackhole with light at centre, going into infinity. Went into a trance-like state where I felt like I was in a deep sleep. "
"Colour - Red, blue, black and white, grey, yellow. 
Warmth
Movement
Static.
Fuzziness.
Giant Red ball/sphere.
kaleidoscope 
Pattern - Symmetry.
Crunchiness 
Smoothness.
Coldness.
Space.
Closeness."
"Spinning discs of Red and Black with waves of green and blue coming off the edges, many other things, a lot to process and remember but beautiful."
"I occasionally suffer from episodes od atrial fibrillation (AF). On a previous Dream Machine visit about a fortnight ago i was in the midst of a week like AF episode. My heart reverted to a normal rhythm whilst in the Dream Machine experience. 

A few days ago another AF episode started. I returned to DreamMachine curious whether it would have the same effect in stopping the AF again. It did! A very strange coincidence? Maybe, maybe not.
"
Undulating melodies and pulsing rhythms resonating with me and through me creating a colours cape universe - it made me happy and smiley - I feel lighter.
"So relaxed — like a being in a cathedral – awe inspiring
Fantastic to have the time to pause and reflect. Thank you. 
"
"Blue and red geometric shapes radiating out from a centre with cloud or waves ‘......’ in the background. Colours changing from blue + red to lilac, orange and yellow. Sometimes a face in the centre but always swirling smoke or waves and diagonally moving images."
"Very prominent salmon pink. Low tone lilac, vivid azure blue. Salmon pink was the most prominent. The muisc I found very sensual form start to crescendo"
I felt the heat on my face when orange pink gave me a big hug. lost in time 
"At the start all I could see was flashy - very bright white light with bright red lights - flashing angrily - it didn’t change for a while - I only saw images or shapes when the light changed to darker - somewhere through it I drifted off and when I woke up I started to see a lot more shapes and colours - each ‘frame’ wouldn’t last very long. Patterns changed in sync to the music and at one point I saw beautiful electric blue and purple lines throughout the background. I opened my eyes briefly and could still see the purple and blue lines, like tracers. After this - quite near the end - the light was a very pale yellow and it was as though I was looking at some kind of soft material that was moving slightly, I could see it slowly undulating."
"Getting sucked into space 
My eyes kept wanting to open to see the experience and I had to consciously keep them closed
At times I did have control over what I saw, at others I didn’t 
My body began to feel as if it was rotating, and my eyes could steer its direction
Clouds kept appearing in the background, but were never fully in focus"
"
I felt like I am in my own universe. That I just need to dig deeper to find that universe. It’s very profound moment. Thank you. 
"
Near the end I felt like I was floating in a foamy milkshake. What preceded was an intense display of spiralling colours and geometric shapes spinning wildly.
"I saw tessellations radiating from the centre of my vision coming towards me at lightspeed.
It was like a kaleidoscope mostly of reds, yellows and blues.
Sometimes I saw grey speckled arcs coming from the left. 
Sometimes I saw blue bubbles coming from the right."
"I found the sounds brought thoughts to my mind. Anxieties worries, daily struggles entered my mind. I struggled to relax and felt more trapped in the world I hoped to escape."
"Initial anxiety then intense relaxation - I almost fell asleep at the end. 
Complete loss of sense of time. 
When awake, felt like I was in a tunnel, brightest light with flashing felt anxious, then ominous, wanting to open eyes + hard to resit this sensation. v . peaceful feeling when dark suddenly comes. 
"
"Bright lights, colours coming towards/away from me and then felt as if I was moving towards the sun. Vivid like a kaleidoscope. Felt like a journey through space, made me feel very reflective immediately after, definitely coming back. Saw lots of patterns/squares"
"Warm colours to white to blue flashing + orange flashing 
Got a little intense so I pulled down the eye cover + enjoyed the sounds instead with colours coming through much more faintly.
Physically ‘......’ b little sick at the intensity
But able to relax + fall to sleep once eye cover was on. "
"Time, space and self blend in a beautiful dance that feels eternally effortless. "
"It felt like I was in a vast pea soup of colour, like a universe with two little grey dots zipping back & forwards. I was watching the two dots as much as they were watching me. It felt like I was in the dream machine for 5 mins tops. There was movement during the experience where it turned sinister & I saw red in the background, grey geometrical shapes. The pink universe was the best for me, it was like floating our in space. The blue was the neurons. Everything was natural, organic apart from the red bit. "
"Kaleidoscope leading to a timezone or time hole entering into own without the warmth on my face. Happiness & comfort of a place behind my eyes familiar to me and myself. I felt like doing my origami or how i feel when i fold paper the dark spaces felt like travelling in space - a dark colours I can’t describe which brought space & peace. I had a sense of being in charlie and the chocolate factory & felt happy& wanted to laugh. I felt good, happy at peace with my space. I might have to retake up orgami again. Thank you. "
"Visual - Pathways, lights, stars (similar to a psychedelic trip but much milder) 
Some faint fractals. 
Feeling calmness, love, peace, gratitude, safety
Thinking - Bringing mind back to present focusing on breat, thought of loved ones 
"
"different experiences - 
love - through love hearts zooming out felt happy, of peace, comfortable
peace - being in a field of greenery, seeing yellow, sounds of hope + optimism, felt free, floating around
black - death, seeing red dots, blackness, echoing sounds, skeletal bodies laying still. felt scared, anxious sad, head felt heavy
rebirth - music changed to hope again, seeing lighter colours, felt positive but with some grief. "
"I was playing in and out of blackhole as seaweek would the tide
A deeply intimate epxeirence that if you think to much would ruin it.
I could see how the music sounded.  
"
"Was mainly a strobing effect like a kaleidoscope generally the same thing throughout with different colours appearing
Sometimes just the black with the red dots and occasionaly multi-colouts in the kaleidoscope
"
"I coudn’t believe the intesnity of the colours
Seen lots of patterns but also a boat, people, stars & Saturn
I was thinking about life & whats happening currently but it felt very very far away!
And I felt sleepy but at peace
"
"I felt a deep sense of peace then eurphoria
The sense that what we perceive in day-to-day only scratches the surface of reality 
Comfort and awe 
"
"The warmest, most inviting, euphoric glow I’ve ever seen. Remnicisent of a beautiful orange sunrise on a peaceful summers day. By surrendering completely, your eyelids relax, body calms and mind wonder into a liminal state or pure serenity. Delicate yet powerful harmonious revolve around you in all emcopssing dance. Surrender and open your mind. 
Thank you to everyone that made the dreammachine possible, and especially Jon Hopkin for one of the best audio experience I’ve ever had. 
"
I hope that’s what death feels like.
"Incredible experience. I am blown away by what I saw. I’ve been in time space tunnels, i’ve been in galaxies, I’ve been everywhere! Very emotional experience for me as I am a highly sensitive person and beauty overwhelems me sometimes. In a good way. Absolutely loved it. Whoever created this - thank you!"
"For the most part, it was like a kaleidoscope. Very bright colours, very geometric, moving very fast forwards the centre or spinning. A lot of bright yellow, which made me smile, I’m not sure why.I just wanted to smile. When the lights came on everything was yellow when off an indigo blue. "
"Felt: warm, peaceful, content ?? loved!
Washed over + surrouded by happy colours/shapes
Almost a feeling of wanting to capture or chase the images behind that were hidden
I also thought, wouldn’t it be great if the ‘real world’ was this magical and colourful 
"
Very calm ! 
"Inspiration for creative project + sculpture 
Contemplations of region, creation + the universe 
"
"Relaxing, enjoyable experience with lovely calming music. Amazed at the colours and patterns experienced. Totally calmed down from the stresses of normal life. "
"I think I didn’t get the full effect as I used my coat as a pillow and all I experienced were LED pulsating lights, when I removed my pillow the experience was much more interesting with a variety of colour + shape."
"So I’ve had a similar visual experience before. My eyes did not want to stay closed. For some reason they kept wanting to open. Not to look at the lights. It was a weird half in half out feeling. The lights refracting off my tears gave me some interesting crystal light structures. Also a valley, some reason I wanted to attribute it to my nose."
"Internal infinity, mirroring external infinity
Cosmoses, nebulae, galaxies
As well as microscopic structures.
Cosmic Broccoli "
"Totally awesome!! Psychedelic!! 
Alternating gradial increases in brightness. Flashing, spinning, feelings of peace and tranquillity. Explosions which moved around slightly. Various colours, greens, blues, reds, orange, yellow, white. Tingling sensation on eyelids. Really wanted to open my eyes at times. But kept them shut as much as I could because I didn’t want to damage my eyesight! Shoulders did get a bit tense, so I tried to move and relax them. 
It felt at times very profound like I had just taken acid. I have never tried this drug but I have had mild hallucinations smoking weed. This was like a big trip. It was really good. The music reminded me of modern psychedelia, which I love. E.g Temples, Tame Impala, the Beatles. The announcer sounded very relaxed as if he had just taken a drug. Maybe he’s just a very chilled guy! His voice made it more thrilling/exciting. Like it was a crazy acid trip! So cool. Would definitely recommend + do again!"
"It started with a light or circle in the centre and geometric circles resonating from there. Warm, smooth, central, then spreading out. Layered circles and geometric patterns, all colours layering, opposite colours standing out against each other, hexagonal patterns. One stage there were pin prick stars of white evenly spaced throughout my vision which would multiply to black, red and larger and larger, 4 spiked stars.
Often a white shape would form at the bottom of my vision, long and thin, but if I tried to focus, everything else would become more intense.
It felt like my eyes were open as if I was actually looking at something. Really at home with the colours. There was a rush and a darkness and the music became deeper towards the end but manageable and still familiar. Lots of yawning after.  "
I got a lot of circles all predominantly pink. As the light faded bubbles would appear around the edges and were soft and pillowy. As the light dimmed further the softness was replaced by more definite lines but the lines were not jarring to me. It was as if they were soft and drawing me in. As they faded it was like a fractal had stopped moving and then dark. But it was certainly a comfortable dark. When the light started again normally in pink but all sorts of colours were merging together. Small lines punctured the peripheral of my vision like tracers in front of the eyes that were static.
"I saw oceans and deserts, I saw every single colour imaginable and it felt like I was navigating through traffic. I saw ‘......’"
"It was a transporting experience
Some of the colours were so vivid and bright, especially the yellows
I felt soothed by the sounds
The spinning, flashing lights was initially jarring but eased as the process went on
The black was pitch black
The colours changed frequently, I saw mostly colours or a pattern of 2-3 colours
Pinks + blues mainly
I felt like I was under the sea at one point. "
"Absolutely amazing - such a beautiful experience.
Totally relaxing - energising - a feeling of floating.
Blast of orange"
"It was like the dawning of a universe. 
Total chaos everywhere forming and moving, coming together to be stilled + formed into light.

Felt overwhelmed, in awe and joy."
"It made feel happy + smile
I feel more relaxed after it.
Seen bright orange, red, soft focused shapes
Would like to have stayed there longer."
"With as little melodrama as possible - the emptiness at the heart of things. In this experience, not in reality. Close-clustered fractals - and what, inbetween? I suspect nothing.
The slippage and the losing hold. Not distressing. "
"Have you ever watched the movie ‘Her’? I felt as if I was in a scene in the movie, staring at the waves pushing onto the sand. I was watching it play out in 3rd person. At one point I felt almost anxious, panicky? Something about the repeating pulse reminded me of a warning."
"Started with geometrical figures, shapes, and straight lines. As I began to relax I began sort of seeing, or feeling like I was in familiar places, like a classroom, a small bridge over a river, an open field, but I could not pinpoint where these places were from or even tell if they were real places.
I knew we were in the room but I felt like we were in one of the other places, and it was so unusual and weird to think that we were not there.
And at some point the muscles of my face started to seize up as the lights felt like they were coming towards me in circular waves. And at some point it felt like something or someone was reaching for me in the “classroom”.
At the end there were also two, relaxed eyes just in the space but they were very vague. "
"Heaviness
Nostalgia
The peaceful feeling of swimming in the sea.
Warmth
Safety - a safe space
Defeat - at some points thoughts crept through. "
"I seen my family and felt a vision on time. Time to enjoy them more and prioritise family time. 
In any other situation or time I think I would’ve felt guilt + anxiety surrounding these feelings but in this I felt peaceful, hopeful and enlightenment.
Time is what I am making it and housework can wait until my children are in bed."
"Warm orange glow - like sunbathing at first 
Then psychedelic kaleidoscope effects - trippy
Some travelling through space - forwards + backwards
When music beat slowed all the vibrant colours went to navy + green loose squares/check - very soothing.
When the gentle music played I didn’t see anything
It was very reminiscent of my youth and experiences with mushrooms.
It felt weird to feel like I’d taken drugs when I hadn’t. Thanks! "
"Main feeling was of sense of my body.
Not being in a physical sense - my mind controlled everything.
I suffer chronic nerve pain and I really did not feel my pain.
Can definitely see this being used in a clinical way. 
An amazing experience."
"Space - connection - freedom - fluidity - ‘......’ - Pulsing - drawing me in and exploding me out.
Deep space inside - somewhere in me - The whole world was created so this moment in time could happen - me blown wide open - without edges - peace. "
"Feeling calm + light coming out of this.
I loved the feeling of the golden light and being bathed in it, warmed by it + the cooling colours near the end.
The need to close my eyes and realising my eyes were closed already!
Going to the breathing + realising how calm I actually was
faces/buildings/landscapes
Amazing colours! Amazing shapes, moving constantly near + away. Peripheral shapes + colours. The music helping me float.
Like watching a kaleidoscope at high speed at times!
Had originally thought it wasn’t for me + really glad I did it. Awesome that my brain was showing me this, + it flowing over my body."
"At times when flashing lights appeared to intensify, this would start as lines of multicoloured light which would eventually focus into a smaller, clearer shape (black on the inside, surrounded by the multicoloured light).
At one point, this shape appeared as a tiny dancing figure, then walking, then dancing again. The figure waved its arms and this sent colours out across ‘the canvas’.
Towards the end, the blocks of colours were textured with tiny kaleidoscopic shapes. "
"At times it felt as though I was travelling through or between two layers of space. Sometimes it felt as though I was travelling through a tunnel. At times it felt as though I was moving towards the space in front of me and at others it felt as though it was moving towards me. I really enjoyed it when connected shape I strung together in a net would wrap round me, then expand and flip into different colours, red to grey, like something was born in front of me and then suddenly changed and decayed around me.
I’m fairly sure I also fell asleep for a little while towards the end. I found it really relaxing! "
"It was somehow what I’d expected when I imagine a combination of Jon Hopkins electronica and white light. I very much enjoyed it and felt comfortable and relaxed and travelled inside my mind.
I would just have liked a longer experience. Maybe an ‘......’ with evolving musical language and space in which to go further inside my consciousness.
Lovely though and a big thank you to all involved, in its creation and delivery.  "
"Weightlessness 
Heaviness
Eyes were closed but seen colour
Spinning sensation
rumbling/vibration
Uplifting feeling
Safety "
"Shapes and dots spiralling out in time with the music. Green silhouettes of everyone else sitting in the room on the periphery when the lights were bright enough, lots of dark blue, red, pink and yellow."
"Lots of white with bursts of yellow
Lots and lots of yellows and oranges."
"Was quite hesitant before but I found the experience very relaxing and enjoyable, almost like an escape. "
"I saw some sort of small stars, I felt comfortable and relaxed. Thanks."
"Sun mostly rising + Sea
Saw all colours and patterns"
I felt deeply relaxed and I was able to conceptualise my research idea and I can now create a graphical abstract of my paper. 
"Mind massage
Busy mind
Body asleep "
"Felt a deep sense of relaxation.
Like my body was floating."
"During the trial experience, I did finf it immeditatley overwhelming, but I really didn’t want to leave so I stayed. I felt a bit thirsty and hand a tiny bit of nausea. Then it seemed to only take a few minutes to feel much more comfortable. The colours were red & black really strongly together, bursts of purple, green white. Everything was whooshing! Loads of geometric shapes - grids, 5 pointer stars, 6 - pointed stars, shapes collapsing in - rushing to the centre, or shooting around on swirling, peeling paths. When I scrunched my eyelids together, the colour became more intensely red & black only. There was usually a centre to the action, that moved with the centre of my vision. When the light left suddenly, it was so interesting, the colours washed away, there was a little bit of lapping of white lines like water around the sides of the picture, then it was gone. :) 
"
"It was initially a really alien experience, something took me a while to settle into but one Idid it was really peaceful. For me, I struggle to find the metaphors / words to describe what I saw - it was experiences i’d had previously that I could liken it to: the sun on my face sitting on a high speed train with the world whizzy by, being in the deep ocean being jellyfish swimming past. Such an interesting experience. Thank you."
"It was like looking down a kaleidoscope. At one point everything went black I saw thousands of stars. Or like I wasin the Millenian Falcon going into into hyperspeed at one point. It felt like I was going forward, and then back.
My mask smelled like American Smarties
I feel incredibly calm.
"
"Corridors zooming forward and backwards, made of different shapes - starting with , then immersed in edges to hexagons and kept getting more edges until it was a circle. 
There figures with triangle heads moving forwards. They duplicated and formed into hundred of triangles with sharp edges and points. These triangles had pale green eyes in the which spanned at fast speeds."
"Felt heavy, lost awareness of legs and arms + eventually hands + feet. I saw a young girl in a field of corn walking in sunshine + blue sky - lovely summers day; very happy place. 
There was also a young boy, older maybe 10/11 in more of a forest looking out on water - 2 separate experiences both really lovely. Made me so happy + relaxed just enjoying the scenes unfolding. It went very quickie for me. 

At other points I saw a variety of colours. All of it was nice! Thank you!
"
"A hand holding onto a field, checked black and white edge
The words ‘TIME TASTY’
Many red months chanting “mememmememmememeh” silently
A person with a large box head walking form right to left 
Falling symbols, black on white
"
"The bottom of the sea spirals, textures, sunrises, wall coming up, now shades of blue, a lot of orange, alot of things that weren’t a particular shape just moving."
"Saw war, death and the burning of ashes of children.
Also saw pretty tunnels and Chinese dragons
"
Peace
"When lights were white in my minds eye I felt warm and I pitched a beach. When lights were dark I had a sensation of a night club, that then turned to night sky."
"The music had a significant effect on the image intensity.
The lighter the light. 
It reminded me if a film from the 70/80s. His Rhodes Dynamic. 
It also reminded me of mandela’s and made me think the significance of these shapes and their relationship to spinal practices. 
"
"feeling of great calmness and peace - like i was the most relaxed I’d ever been - timelessness. Felt like it went on for both a very long and short time at the same time. The music was a key part of the journey/experience as much as the lights for me (Thank you John Hopkins). It was very meditative and utterly absorbing too. 

Visually I saw a mix of red and blue fractals, little white boxes, and more sun/pulsing like images. Lots of hexagon type images as well as the cube to start with, becoming larger and more and less defined + fluid as time went on. Fantastic experience - thanks to all involved. "
"Dreamlike State 
transcendental meditation 
Without linear direction 
Overwhelming euphoria
sensory deprivation 
lack of sight but visually clear 
Poor direction but made me feel pushed towards “……..” on life
drugs without drugs"
"- euphoric - a central point - a light
- source with symmetrical shapes 
- surging forward me then away 
- intense purple - sense of clouds 
- surging towards + over me
- a horizon line - every colour
- imaginable - total symmetry 
- Like floating inside a nebula "
"When lights were white in my mind’s eye I fell warm and I pictured a beach.
When lights were dark I had sensation of o nightclub, that then turned to night sky."
"Gaels, complex machines, stairs, central american figures, train, propellers, oceans, a lemon man, butterflies, tunnels"
"Warm and relaxed, then content and feeling of peacefulness
The very first 30 seconds were a bit of surprise then very relaxed after.
"
"Carried through lights, stars, tunnels, bursts of light 
Sunbursts spiralling, a face of a being - like out of yourself and on a journey.
Space.
"
"I felt I was in a desert, then floating on the sea. At some point, I felt I floated in the space."
"
A Mosaic of Magma - I thought “How much of this can I manifest while still relaxing and letting go?”
"
"First word is “WOW”! Next two words are “Just WOW”!
After that, there are no words. Or at least I haven’t the words to do it justice. However, i’ll give it a go.
An intense experience for sure but at no point unpleasant or uncomfortable. The immersion into sound and light was so involving that one forgot there were three other senses left untroubled.
The range of patterns of colours were just incredible and too numerous to try and describe beyond always moving and always changing. The places I was taken varied between crustal-clear aquamarine seas and deep space in kaleidoscopic protective bubble. 
One takeaway from this is the removal of any fear of death. I mean if the spirit lives on, connected to the great consciousness, after the body dies, then the Dreamachine journey told me what that might be lie. perhaps a useful tool for preparing terminally ill for for the crossing point. "
"Quite relacing, starting with flat colour - red/orange to yellow
When strobes flashed, patterns appeared + moved with lots of intense colours
Like a kaleidoscope- with movement + swirling. An amazing variety - This was my second time of the Dream Machine + although similar was different - There appeared to be more fine details within the patterns than before. When the lights dimmed without strobes I got an intense feeling of space and lovely deep blue patterns.
Following my first experience I felt that I had better peripheral vision + appeared to take in more of what I was seeing in the world around me. This lasted for a couple of days - I’m looking forward to checking if this happens again - I really appreciate the opportunity to have experienced the Dream Machine.
"
"
Swirling circles in bigger circles. Lots of hexagons. Lots of little stars. Very calming. At first mind was clear then I started thinking of everyday things. I was sad when it stopped I wondered if I could make my own one at home. What would happen on other substances mind altering “substances”. How much was timed to the music?
"
"I could feel fluctuation in energy with the sounds. I went from a tranquil place, 
to imagining a desert landscape/war zone with helicopter type sounds followed by a
serene sense of floating over a glacier. Despite the multiple imaginary journeys in a short space of time I came out of the experience feeling well rested. 
"
"Took me a while to relax and enjoy it. Music reminded me of “........” 70s “.......” Pink Floyd.
Was “floating” at points of it. “......” Would like to try for “.....” 
Saw pastel colours + rather than bright floating lights. Felt calm.
"
Felt like I was falling through the black hole like intersetllar! Out of the world experience!
"I saw two location that are very familiar to me, but I cannot put my finger on the name of them, or where they indeed are. The hard I try to remember, the m ore they disappear as in a dream… "
"I felt like I was on a kaleidoscopic journey through the cogs of a brocken clock to the deepest horror & sweetest summers day. All rolled into one disenchanted, fragile, unbreakable, tender, human moment. I wasn’t prepared for the feeling of being touched. "
"
Feelings of my vision opening outward as the music swelled and colours and shapes filled everything; when the light went low, everything turned vivid royal blue and black and I felt loss. As the lights rose, I saw green webbing like a digital matric as the world rebuilt itself. 
"
It was very meditative. I started to lose a sense of where my limbs were in space. I almost fell asleep. I couldn’t feel my hand by the end of it. 
"Various spots of light + some geometric shapes. 
"
"I ocassionaly saw an overall grid. Otherwise I completed a letter intended to write tomorrow - one I had a good sleep “............” a noise in the “........” and some lights - brighter of and on

I am amazed to see other people drawing coloured patterns. Sorry about my handwriting. Thank all the same. 
"
"It felt like I was floating /in space/ inside a disco ball. It felt very peaceful. 
I want to watch something recreates what I saw. 
"
"
I saw a lot of hexagons, wavy patterns. A lot of swirly dark blue lights. 
"
"I saw beautiful colours & light, calming, bright then soothing & dark . Flares switching to kaleidoscope shapes then to more colour. I felt soothed. I felt calm. I feel happy!
Thank you for the opportunity.
"
"I saw the tree of life and the structure of the molecules in my cells. I saw now, and a galaxy spinning and all the many layers of the multiverse sliding by each other so close I felt that I saw god and she saw me and I wept. "
"This was the second time I had come to DM - as with the first time was amazing! Quite different visually - again started very optical - much more shimmery & less analogue than my last experience - more kaleidoscope. Felt calm, energised and alive! Felt like mind was showing you what else is out there, endless possibilities. At times felt like pulling/draining you in and other times moving in a circular motion. Magic!"
"I saw colours predominantly reds and blues - the most amazing red and electric turquoise blues. Patterns would form move and dissolve as the rhythm of the flashing lights & music changed. When I “looked up” I saw yellows and greens, but I wasn’t able to control the changes and sometimes moving my eyes didn;t have any impact on what was going on. 

It was pleasant and i’d like to do this again in order to compare my experiences I am left with many question to ponder upon now. :)
"
"I felt very relaxed. There was lots of shapes, lots of blues and oranges. I ended up running though some very important tasks, which need done. I believe that I fell asleep at multiple points. Very relaxing, what a new experience! What a time to reflet and decompress from a busy life. "
"I felt like I was underwater. Like in a void or vast space but did not feel like I was alone. I saw weeds? Maybe underwater. Then 3 people? They were smiling quite happy. Then white little lights spreading out from the centre. There was also a burst of colour from red to yellow. A lot of warmth. A lot of warmth. It was very relaxing experience, very pleasant and also a sense of wonder. The venure was very good and comfortable. The staff are accommodating and helpful. Also felt like im very well rested. "
"A great diversity of Kaleidoscope patters, colours, rhythms and textures. Sometimes crystals or fractal patterns, ripples on water, waving leaves with light reflecting on them. Red, green, yellow, purple. Didn’t look anything like the picture I drew! Very relaxing, initially slow a bit disappointing, but …… mind better doing the 20 minute session. Wished it had been longer!"
"I saw lots of colours, mainly yellows blues and red. At some points it kind of looked like outer space, sometimes I saw flower shapes, and other times it was like the cogs in a machine. I felt a sense of awe and gratitude for my brainand how it works/what it does. I also felt a little bit sad toward the end, my heart area in my chest felt closed and heavy. It was amazing, thank you so much for putting this on for free. It reminded me of a psilocybin experience I had and also of the Luminate app experience. Thank you!"
I saw moving stars and crosses in lots of colour combination - red + blue most common with white flashes. I saw dark green and blue/navy ‘scales’ patterns like viens on a leaf. Some amazing blue - I didnt want these to go. A big yellow to rich red orb. My mind wandered at times to things I had in my thoughts. I feel relaxed after the experience like after yoga class or a session in the swimming pool.
"I saw shapes, spirals, tunnels, I felt like I was mocing within a space without any dimension. I felt like I was not made of real matter. I was just nothing and I could go wherever I wanted to. My mind pictured the universe, the planets, the stars, the galaxies, and atoms. 
I pictured lot of orange yellow and red. When picturing the blue, I found myself underwater and I could go wherever I wanted to. There was always something in the middle of the frame, that is a face, an object, a geometric shape. That thing got always closer and closer until in disappeard. 
"
"The overwhelming imagery I got was a large, yellow, floral shape that was ever-growing and spinning. I saw human cells dividing and dividing until it turned into a tunnel. I was shooting through the tunnel with stars all around me and at the end of the tunnel I saw a heart. I felt joy and strong emotions coarse through my body. I saw fractal like shapes and things that resembled mandalas."
"I saw a recurring badger. I wonder what it is like to be a badger. I conclude only a badger would know, similar to a philosopher Thomas Nagels observations about a rat. Otherwise I just saw various shapes + colours - things I would expect to see if bright light was shone in my eyes for a prolonged period of time. A very interesting experience! Indeed one-off experience for me. "
"The lights + music mostly made me think of warmth and sunshine - although there was a part in the middle where the colours were colder and the music felt a bit more threatening. 
The colours looked very intense, vivid and beautiful and the experience was relaxing and pleasant.
I did not see pictures - just emerging patterns and an overwhelming feeling of good will. "
"I felt fear. Then I felt joy. I felt lack of control and I felt ultimate control. I saw an arabic word hidden in colourful orbs. I saw a mountain range from above. I saw my two future children sitting on a sand dune. I saw stars and stars and eyes. I saw tunnels and infinity. I saw how the movement was up to me. I felt tingles in my hands and tones. Like little spasms of “....” energy rising. Buzzing in my whole body. Energy building. I felt at peace and in awe. 

A huge difference between when I focused on the images in front of me and when i first let them happen. A zen that I’m grateful for 3x. 
"
"I felt truly relaxed. Almost asleep but still focused. My brain felt calm although it was still thinking about life stresses. It was like looking through a maelstrom of coloured squares getting pulled deeper under water. I feel like there should be more of these mentally freeing experiences. Very enjoyable to treat it as a group activity, even though we were strangers going in. "
"Was a mostly relaxing experience. At first a bit daunting.
Geometric, hexagonal, vibrant, wavy, psychedelic.
Similar to when I took amphetamines and psychedelics drugs years ago, such as lsd and mushrooms
Felt a bit like moving into another dimension/s.
Visuals worked well with audio, although the visuals felt much more powerful to me, maybe being a visual artist?
Was conscious that it was a group experience, although this ‘.....’ uncomfortable. Was relaxed in a social sense.
Not sure but the audio might work better with headphones.
Only main disruption for me is an uncomfortable neck/head. I do suffer from a bad back now and again, but the absence of a pillow was uncomfortable for myself."
"My second time: still felt a real sense of euphoria. Felt like waves of warm light gently flowing over me. It was very dynamic and varied and although qualtittaively the same as my first time the patterns felt different or at least not the same. Feels impossible to draw anything that would really reflect the experience or at least convey it to others. 

I would have loved fot it to last longer. I felt very at peace, relaxed. I felt very curious about what drove the patterns, whether the douns drives it. I tried moving my eyes closed to see if it would have an effect.
"
"It felt like I was seeing, but without seeing. It was almost dreamlike drifting between being aware of where I am and not aware. It felt like summer, but from a long time ago, so fuzzy that all I remember is the feeling: an empty nostalgia. 

Geometric black and white pattens would engulf most of my vision, rotating and spiraling left and right, seemingly random. I felt scared to let go fully and immerse myself, but after a while, without me ever knowing I was fully gone. It’s just a shame that I would quickly realise and snap out of it. :(
"
"There aren’t enough pinks, red + orange colours to show what I saw.
The colours all except one occasionally repeating brown mushroom one were all vivid and neon - pinks with turquoise. Orange + navy - deep red + black.
Sometimes there were letters + numbers I couldn’t read. 
Near the end there was a Giant Jellyfish gently lapping its white tentacles all over the room.
Lots of kaleidoscopes 
Lots of plaid/tartan.
Feelings across the small of back + my chest like I was very excited. "
"At one point I saw a tree with a load of green leaves blowing in the wind. 
The leaves began to turn into little triangles and the whole tree gradually opened up like a kaleidoscope, in black and white.
Gradually it changed shape and I could see Purple, blue, green and orange shapes. 
"
"
This was way better than Belfast. Ulster says Dream Machine. Actually the ice rink is giving me charlie and the chocolate factory 2005 vibes. I mean that as a high compliment !! Really cool venue & epic space. 
"
It was a warm and relaxing space which allowed me to feel comfortable enough so as to close my eyes. I feel I have drifted apart at some point. I felt the light was too bright for such a meditative experience. I would have preferred the light to be more textured and layered so could accompany the changes of the music.
"I really enjoyed the experience the sounds, colours + ambience just getting to relax and have time to myself.
I found it hard at first to keep my eyes closed as I wanted to see the different colours but after a few minutes I managed to relax and keep them closed. That made the experience better as I could see + feel the colours more strongly."
"I was lost in thought thinking of my kids and all of a sudden the noise of the experience sucked me back to reality. Then I felt as though I was on a rollercoaster. For a second or two, then it was back to my thoughts. It felt like I was on another planet. Wasn’t sure if I was an alien or not. "
"Soothing, magical experience.
Amazed how the brain creates figures, colours and shapes just through strobe and sound!
Was able to take control of small part of the big picture and create swirls and bring them towards me!"
"Very relaxing, yet intense
When music was calm and the lights were dimmed. Saw shadows moving. Woman dancing. dog/Fox approaching.
Often looked light ‘Big Bang’ style explosion of space. Stars flying at eyes. 
Tons of intense colours + shapes like a kaleidoscope.
Not dissimilar to the tunnel scene in Charlie and the Chocolate factory."
At one point I felt momentarily ‘weightless’ as if I was beginning to roll forward. 
"I saw all sorts of coloured squares, moving from and towards a central red point, mandala style. Sometimes instead of squares I saw spirals/circles. For a few seconds I saw complex shapes. "
"Lots of circular shapes. Peripheral shapes which were round with orange, yellow and warm colours. 
Much more relaxing than the first time I done it."
"At the beginning I was very afraid, as the light movements where fast and sharp. But with the main experience slowed down. Still lots of sharp shapes not flowing colours. At the end of the experience it felt as if a curtain was and light coming in like in the morning and flowed into purple. I felt very relaxed and tired at the end. The breathing exercises really helped with bringing me back after mind wandered. "
"Lots of colours such as blue, indigo and purple. There were lots of strokes of light, as well as red and oranges. It felt like I was moving through the universe. "
"Travelling through tunnels. Sometimes forward and sometimes backward. An outline at the end of tunnel but never quite reaching it. Felt eager to reach the end and frustrated that I couldn’t. When it went dark it was like the sea at night time, calm waves. It felt calm. Then a pale orange and purple swirl pattern. It was slow and peaceful."
"Orange yellow lights
Going into the after.
I saw you - not body - soul.
In green.
Lines at first
diamonds.
Then dots. Dots.
Helicopter
Rotating landing?
Life living… after.
Tumbling slowly.
Deep
Breath.
Eye red eye.
In the blur
Focus and unfocus
Interchanging spontaneous chaos
JUXTAPOSITION."
"I can’t remember ever feeling so calm or switched off from the outside world. I felt happy, excited and relaxed all at the same time. 
I could see mainly red/orange triangles pulsing at the start. Rainbows would often appear, pulsing quickly.
My favourite image was the booking almost on fire with smoke rising up.
I also enjoyed seeing a huge pair of black eyes watching it all with me.
Thank you so much for this incredible experience!"
Strange mixture of awe/anxiety/relaxation. Amazement that the brain can function so randomly
"Strong sense of calm and peace, lots of feeling as if I was in an ocean. Felt as though I was watching a snapshot of some people I know on the tv."
"Lots of geometric shapes and spirals patterns 
Sunset vibes
Travelling through the vision"
"I suppose I would describe it like travelling through a ‘geometric cosmos’. Kind of like when you see documentaries taking you on journeys through/to the stars and heavens. Except rather than traversing the galaxy I was traversing lots of geometrical bodies, which flashed technicolour; reds and greens were particular salient, as was white. There also sometimes appeared to be a circle or hole near the centre of my visual field, which was the destination or focal point of the journey."
"The music seem to shape and colour the shapes. It feels hard to write now as my hands are heavy and relaxed. Life events on my mind came to the fore and I felt more angry about these, more so than in real life."
"I saw a lot of fractal shapes, but also more complete images: a cloudscape, a person pushing a pram, faces and skulls. I have a lot of visual hallucinations like this when I fall asleep normally and a lot of these were familiar to me. I also felt a sense of movement x floating which I also associate with sleep. I’m pretty sure I didn’t fall asleep. "
"Striking experience, well worth it. Transitions seemed too abrupt or sudden at times, would have preferred + gradual or smooth transition.
While temperature was fine, I found my feet became too cool and distracted me from the experience. "
"Strong strong colours - reds, greens, blues
Geometric shapes/lines
Intense colours -symmetrical shapes - all going into a centre/focal point
Tessellation/white lines
Totally relaxed -fully concentrating on what I could see."
"Wonderful experience, different and full of dreams!
Different and varied shapes and colours pass through the mind, moving and moving, go and come, come and go.
Glad to have experienced it! "
"Once I relaxed into the experience I felt very relaxed and stopped thinking.
I was quite nervous about the whole thing. So the taster at the beginning is a master stroke.
Marvellous experience. "
"Processions of patterns, multicoloured primary colours plus mixes of orange, purple brown.
Brownian motion, tessellation. Largely symmetrical but occasional bands of stripes in bottom left. Sometimes 3 dimensional, with great depth - clouds moving or architectural shapes - movement like being in a stationary train while the one beside moves or on a boat going across a very strong current and the shore slipping past.

Calmness, surprise.

Frequency effects like sand on a plate being vibrated through a range of frequencies. "
"Laughter in the demo. Smiles, squinted but closed eyes, clear mind.
Vivid + frequent red and blue in sharp + straight lines, then pinks/purple wavy lines, like when you’re in really clear water and see the water reflecting on the sand below.
Spirals of yellows, greens, and white.
Returning to black by journey through deep, misty blues and violets and indigos.
Releasing, emptying, slowing, welcoming sensations, body heavy, eyes alive, soul alive. "
"Intense fear
Intense anxiety
Complete loss of self thinking
Controlled
Otherworldly 
Dry mouth
Shaking
Presence of something not of this world.
Feeling of something unnatural. 
Almost, almost walked out but pushed through to end. "
"The natural world, like baraka (film)
‘......’
Cities
Natural landscapes
Stars
Cosmos
Trippy
Universal
Many peoples
Soaring
Vibration
Sometimes breathless
refreshing."

"This was my second visit.
Surprisingly I experienced completely different patterns/colours.
Even though it was the same sound track, it appeared to be louder/a bit crazier this time around. I was able to relax a bit better though.
A lot of the colours appeared to mix with either a hole/wheel in the middle spreading outwards."
"The closest thing to a k-hole
It took me through space and time.
In the beginning, focused more on the visuals. But half way in, a more lucid “drifted away” feeling. "
"Vivid colours - stained glass colours
Silhouettes of a head
Eyes looking back at me
A heart
vortex"
"Felt like being in the middle of an orange/blue kaleidoscope for quite a considerable amount of time.
But then also like existing in greyscale - watching the trails of cloud going across the sky, with dots/stars popping up across the sky - it's almost to the extent that all colour didn’t exist until it would go completely black. "
"A lot of red and blue fractal and geometric patterns appeared. I enjoyed being in fields of colour at times - an amazing fluorescent pink! At one point I felt I was in an ocean of golden pink and I loved this part of the experience. I felt at times that I was travelling down a dark corridor of doors, woodland, coastline. A heart surrounded by colour emerging from the patterns. "
"Light
Sacred geometry
Spirals, calm, joy + beauty
What a beautiful experience. Proper magic. The music was perfect to go deeper on the journey within.
I dropped into a space of peace + ease + love."
I felt a series of emotions from anxiety transgressing into euphoria. Ending with a sense of melancholy. My final image was of a galaxy fading from view and I as the watcher or space traveller slowly falling back from sight. I saw lots of yellows. I think this is significant because it was my sisters favourite colour. Somewhere in all that yellow I saw the faint view of a face. I think it was my sister. Or at least I hope so.
"Warm orange sunset colours
Falling through the middle of an apartment block. Blue, yellow + pinks - similar to a twister lolly.
Lattice formations.
Intense ripples like a stone being thrown into water. "
"Lots of warm orange tones when starting up and in between periods of flashing.
Was like a turn of a kaleidoscope.
Periods of neon pink  and yellow dots I enjoyed but they were very brief.
Some visuals and images much sharper than others which were geometric but blurry."
"I saw so many incredible & bright colours, in so many dyanmic and geometric patterns always with continuous movement in many direction and dimensions. Sometimes it felt intense, and I wanted to close my eyes but they were already closed! I also felt like I was being pushed back further into my own body, and the time felt I was just floating through space. Mostly I felt there was a whole universe, an infinite space. Just within me. The movement was just amazing to feel. Wow absolutely loved it! Wish I could start everyday with a little dose of this experience. It made me realise how much of life is internal, and how incredible that internal experience can be. I will try to close my eyes and relive it. Thank you for creating this. And please produced so I can do at home. "
"Warp + weft optically stimulating across human history for millenia - in the Outer Heribdes,the Vickings early people, human who have used haluciogenics to tap into the experience of being human at different levels / at a deeper level. Thank you so much for this beautiful experience. This was extraordinary."
"I mainly “saw” kaleidoscope patterns radiating out from the centre, with different colours and patterns, also varying intensities and repeat frequencies. At one point similar to old Dr. who opening credits. "
"I mainly saw kaleidoscope patterns radiating out from the centre, with different colours and patterns, also varying intensities and repeat frequencie. At one point similar to the old Dr.Who opening credits. "
Different colours which moved in rhythm to the music. They generally moved from the centre out. It was quite relaxing. 
"Beautiful vivid colours stepped inside a sunset a few times lots of colour changes and patterns when the flashing is flat. So fast and bright, try to capture it but they are too fast. "
"Lots of diamonds 
Fidgety
Restless legs
Thirsty 
Loved the orange light - very womb-like
Enjoyed the music - very immersive
Felt like on a space journey - if I was a passenger on a long haul journey."
Incredible! Belfast holds my heart but the guardian here were fantastic and the         experience. I am the dreamachine!
"
Powerful. But not as good as Belfast. PS (I joke) Saw more black and white than usual which was really cool and added to the unique aspect of trying the Edinburgh version. I miss the dreamachine :(
"
"Cute. Could do with some arches. Get your colonist hands of the dreamachine!!

"Anxious at first then breathed into the experience
From then, felt relaxed
Enjoyed it
"
"Closest possible imagination of travelling at the speed of light through space, galaxies, wormholes, vortexes. Totations, swirls and a myriad of patterns indescribable. Sometimes feeling close enough to touch, other times very far away."
"Wow! What an amazing experience of sound and kaleidoscope colours transmitting behind my eyes in various rhythms.
I seen every colour under the sun and also raced into a euphoric feeling of joy. Each vision dominoed into the next one.
Almost a spiritual experience."
"Lots of pink and white shapes flashes
With a kaleidoscope in the background.
Sometimes with a mask shape like an egyptian mask in the centre"
"Similar to certain acid trips.
Lots of tunnels, being pulled through them
Felt like I needed to ‘let go’ more. There was another part of it I couldn’t access.
Was trying to focus my eyes on parts of the shapes, but had a different ‘trip’ when I stopped that, I could get more of a feeling then
Got tingles at several points
Completely lost myself at points
Was aware it was my eyeballs I was seeing. I liked that there were a lot of grids, not sure if that’s the video game I’ve been playing.
Many reds and blues but some beautiful colours in between more purples and greens, fading into each other, being pulled away by each other. Quite ghostly at times. Definitely otherworldly. Little green dots mingling with the dark purple background."
"I mainly saw 3 different patterns:

A warm centre, like a dot which may have resembled a sun, with many rays coming out of concentrically in different shades of yellow.
A purple and red group of hives.
The square which was my mental canvas. Started to fold on itself like pages in a book curling on each other.
In all of them my body was getting lighter and lighter as a ‘......’ of the room and with less self! "
"Light felt slightly stressful to start but then as I focused on the noise + colours. I felt sleepy, potentially half sleeping/dreaming. I feel calm + soothed now."
"Bursting light, white pink, red, orange, blue, green, blue, yellow. 
Kaleidoscopic movement, lava lamp swirls,
Tides like sunset and sunrises
From the top, left, right and bottom
It’s like inside a circle."
"Initially, it was intense and surprising how much so. It was hard to take in what I saw at the start, but when the light faded, I saw purple waves slowly lessening in intensity as the light dropped further into the experience. It was like everything was spinning, and I could see blue sky. It was as if I was lying on snow and could see snowy trees and mountains all around. Not sure if I saw that because I wanted to see it, or if my mind was creating it unintentionally, but I do love the mountains and snow. Very pleasant and eye opening (closing) experience."
"Psychedelic colours mostly red + green also purple.
Similar to Michael Caine in the film
Ipcress file when he is trying to get brain-washed.
"
"Had a very relaxing experience. The light kept giving me the illusion that it was expanding and getting closer to me. I seen shadows at times behind the light that reminded me of two hands reaching into the light and the slowly pulling away out of the light in opposite directions to one another. As the light faded darker I felt like my eyes got heavier every time until I couldn’t keep them open.
Loved it."
"Completely shocked at the amount of colour, movement, design/shapes that can be created by white light alone. Kept opening my eyes just to check it was really being generated by white light. 
Towards the end the intensity and movement it created became a bit too strong. My eyes kinda hurt, like when you cross your eyes for too long lol.
It was great, love to do it again.
Such an amazing 360 degrees experience, great atmosphere and support from staff. 10/10."
"Deep calmness.
Childlike joy. Euphoric. Like a kid at the beach on a dull day. Felt like looking out at the sea - like the vastness and emptiness of it. At times felt like I was being held. Like I was in the womb. Then plunged into the dark like I was in space. untethered . unattached. Unsettled by it for a second but then once I sank into it I felt at peace. "
"At 1st I saw warm orange light that turned yellow. During the flashing lights I saw like chicken wire, rough stone wall grey. The light felt oppressive, coming onto me. Patches of red, blue, little dark green dots popped in the field. Then when the flashing stopped the colours were aquamarine and purple. They slowly moved to warmer, calmer tones of pink, orange…
At one time it looked like bubbles."
"Peace, tranquillity, moulded into the space.
Interstellar, cosmos, “dreamy”, light.
(Some words that spring to mind)
A deep sense of glow.
Radiant (even with my eyes closed) "
"Geometric swirling rhombus deep + gentle patterns.
A sense of letting go and knowledge we are all totally unified as one. Without ego - no eyes just feeling. A beautiful reminder again. Thank you."
"I keep my eyes open
I just seen lights
But it was so relaxing at times
The light was too bright
So I keep opening my eyes and got sore head
I smelt people smell feet"
"First adjustment: letting go was difficult. Then nothing darkness. Then light. White. Then every single colour I was weightless free to follow and chose the colour as they progressed. 
Then my mind began to imagine different physical scenarios. Kind of looking through a dome at starry skies. A dancer twirling. Finally family and loved ones. So many memories flooded back one at a time each loosely connected to each other. All centred to people who I love and care for. Overwhelming sense of content."
"Kept my eyes open the whole time and just couldn’t let myself get into a relaxed state of mind unfortunately.
But do notice some stomach sensations.
I was also thinking the light was going to fall out of its fixtures and fittings. "
"Chilly pepper jelly is a good idea
Orange is underrated 
The breath work helps when you ran 40 minutes here IN TWENTY MINUTES"
"I felt I was floating out into space
As the music began to get louder
And then gently floating back as 
Music became softer, like returning
To earth, very relaxing."
"Music energising, patterns of pink, white, green, red squares, triangles, neon squares, dark black shapes. Pulses of colour"
"Felt very relaxed and at peace. My thoughts floated away, I almost fell asleep. I felt very safe and comfortable, and felt very refreshed after. "
"Felt like the sun was on my face. 
Dancing in the cosmos.
I think too much about work + don’t focus on the other things around me. "
A bright sun.
I saw lots of abstract shapes but one recurring image was a hyper flashing cross that was pulsing in the centre.
I felt like I was looking at a million different eternities. When I opened my eyes they did not feel real anymore
"At first I felt relaxed, like I was lying on a beach with the sun on me. When the lights began to move and I started to see so many different things. I felt a burst of joy and excitement. At times I tried to move my eyes or focus on something, to see how much I could control it. I loved it. When the lights went off as the visions in the dark were some of the most beautiful. The movement was fast and sometimes everything rushed away. The most special thing about it was a brilliant blue jewel that kept appearing. It had green and yellow glowing edges and gave a profound sense of peace. "
Beautiful vivid colours stepped inside a sunset a few times. Lots of colour layers and patterns when the flashing is fast. So fast and bright. Try to capture but they are too fast.
"I felt relaxed and stimulated. It was gentle and joyous. Like closing your eyes underneath a sky with the sun shines. Through the leaves. It self like a hug, warm and caring my mind felt empty and full. "
It was a lovely experience. I had no idea what to expect. It was like yoga relaxation period - but more intense. I had a sense of movement then a gradual slowing. 
Felt like being in the sea for a while and saw blue water around. 
A pack of cards folding aggressively until the last one hit the deck then a bright light or spark which snapped me back to another scene. A catherine wheel of bright yellow & fuschia.
"Travelling forward, floating, sinking emerging. Bright vivid blue lights, from a soft pale pink weave, warm and cold feelings. "
"Felt so happy and relaxed, such a lovely experience, so calming lots of white short stripes moving clockwise, warm purple shade with some reds.
"
For the first ¾ of the event I experience very little. However when the lighting changed to red I began to see shimmering pattern of red and orang - I am red/green colour blind. It was inall a very relaxing experience. 
"Felt totally relaxed, then eyes twitched, saw block colours, my heart pounding, then yellows and blue colours, no other feelings felt. "
"Like being at a Tangerine Dream, Swans 919.
Enjoyed playing with focus on the eyeball. Was like looking out a space capsule at a blue moon/planet. 
"
"
All circles 
"
"I saw myself on a deser clone with the hot sun on my skin and a warm and flashing breeze in the air. There were waves tossing around below me but they wasn’t threatening. There was a small but strong —------ very distinctive. And the sky was cloudless, limitless and vivid blue. Everything felt hopeful and passionate, infinite but also fleeting. I felt aware and weightless at the same time. I felt like being born and welcoming death in the same moment."
"
A lot movement of colour initially. But then the coulours took over. First there were mainly waves of blue and green which then gave way to these sandy buildings. They were ancient and being parraled by the waves. It felt like it was this ______ being outside time and space. It was very moving to see flowers and stars open and burst and fade away. Just accepting but still in awe of  all that was being curated inform of me. 
"
When I was worried if my tinnitus was being affected I didnt not relax so much. I thought about my worries a bit I really enjoyed some movement of peace in it. I have fear loads of bees buzzing in a cherry tree and that was an amazing noise. I think the more natural you can get the noise better. 
"Loads of different patterns, no humans or animals . When sitting down to draw I felt guided (and I’m a rationalist) in what I was drawing, as if I was (am) sitting in a particular zone."
"
I felt distant and close heavy and light, bright then dark too much and then not enough 
"
"Bright colours, yellow, oranges reds movement circles moving clockwise + counter clockwise at the same time. Columns moving toward me. Women - bowing towards me, mainly old womens arm reaching out toward me a forest at night. That I was gliding through, dark + blue becoming a white, snow-covered field and then a desert, vast, yellow empty. So many shapes - all moving breathing. "
"Uplifting, relaxing at points, sometimes floating above or in space. Colours and patterns were sometimes, vibrant, warming, made me feel very comfortable. Felt like moving a very fast at times like being on high speed train. "
"
Free calm peaceful

"Moving toward a swirly cavity, welcoming inviting, connecting."

Spiral as in I’m in the Universe
"The universe in patterns, colours and geometric patterns. I felt a sense of wonder and at one with the universe I felt myself travelling through space and time and an overwhelming feeling of love and peace. "
"
I was relaxed & comfortable. I didn;t want to move my eyes too much in case I felt motion sick! I had impression of space briefly. Predominantly tiles of blue & vivid orange yellow & teals then fluffy yellow & purple. I was reminded of travelling on a train with bright sunlight flashing, fast travel through a machine and at times like a carousel-spinning.

"Letter number combinations - 7B 2C 
Kaleidoscopic Patterns. Hexagonal, rotating clockwise. 
"
It was a relaxing experience. Thought it was too short. 
Totally surreal experience. Total relaxation. 
Relaxed but at times anxious as well. I felt myself twitching uncontrollably at times. 
I saw geometric shapes. Bright colours filled with positive auras. I felt how incredible the mind & imagination actually is.
"This experience brought memories from the past and make me saw new forms to be.
A better person, a happier person, more relaxed and not overthinking about everything -
Happiness, I saw happiness and and cool ‘......’ forms of life."
"There seemed to be what I first thought was a focus or terminus of green light - But the more I looked at it with my eyes closed, I realised it wasn’t a focus, but a wormhole of sorts. Light spilled into it. I did not. "
During the taster and the beginning I found it difficult to ground myself for some reason. But I put the trust in my breathing and continued. This experience was similar to a lot of the psychedelic trips I’ve had. A floating feeling and tingle all over my body. It’s fascinating how you're able to get that surreal experience with only lights and sounds. Wonderful experience.
"Floaty, swinging in a hammock.
Some weightlessness, loss of sensation.
Around arms - pleasant numbness
Calm curious.
Geometric shapes
Wide range of colours
Focal point - dots red/blue triangular details radiating out
Hexagons. Lots of red and blue, then more diffuse colour and shape too.
Built in intensity with sound, bass.
Red stream like platelets in blood.
Sensation of sunshine, diffuse light.
Leaf shapes
Shifts in focus -layers of visuals.
Starry sky. Expansive, space-like feeling.
Want to be immersed in the sound -
Needed to feel it as well as hear it. "
The colours were amazing. After the initial reds and flashing yellows the blue and black was a different experience. I felt like I became nothing and it was so peaceful. It was like disappearing into a safe space. It was only when I became aware of my body again that I realised I hadn’t been connected to my body at all. Peaceful.
"A lot of 90 degree symmetry - as if 2 mirrors were placed at right angles to each other.
Movement tended to be right to left.
Most rotation was clockwise
A lot of blue/orange shapes.
Amazing how quickly shapes changed.
Was aware of my own hands - thought I could see them!
Fantastic experience!!"
Intense colours. Some just pure colours like a sunset made so Van Gogh yellow. Flashing + rotating patterns. Some patterns like interference on an old analogue tv. Some like honeycomb. Sometimes indistinct shapes appeared. Saw virtually every colour in the spectrum. Felt very relaxed. Was sorry when it ended. 
"Relaxing and no real awareness of length of time within the space, very calm but wore mask and couldn’t experience things. Took mask off and saw kaleidoscopic imaging."
"Lots of constantly moving fractal patterns like a kaleidoscope with a repeating paw print in them.
Lots of checkerboards of swapping colours, sometimes half the image was in greyscale and the other half in vibrant colour.
Time went by super quickly, the whole experience felt like it only lasted ⅘ minutes. "
"All oranges and yellows, some reds + occasionally blues. Low light experiences involved sparkling lights floating, with blues haze. Bright lights were all reds/orange either swirling, or more often, geometric, rolling out from the centre like a kaleidoscope.

Sometimes felt like scuba-diving (sounds are non directional and muted, and colours are soft)."
I experienced a series of visuals colour images and moods like a flash image that began to transform. I felt like I was drifting off to sleep sort of bridging consciousness and all the surreal visual soo was oozing out in bursts with other moments of calm and light. Warmth sunlight memories of big bodies of water and bright sunshine and dropped shadow and light with sensory associations. I found it difficult to retain and remember the details of so many images somewhat like a dream when I awoke. 
"A forest of greens. A green turtle swimming through turquoise sea. A blue “ball” flying from left to right with smaller darker blue balls orbiting around it. All these lower intensity, “narative” session here in a brightly coloured cartoon style. "
"I was really nervous about it but remembered breathing exercises throughout and was ok, I was really in awe initially, felt really full of wonder. As the lights intsensifed so did the patterns in my mind. At one point where the music where the music took a darker run I used my eye mask because it was quite overbearing. The patterns and colours were very intense and sometimes they just got a bit too much. I am neurodivergent + have aphontasia so I am not able to see mental imagery, I was very overwhelemed + suprised to see pictures, colours + patterns in my minds eye because of this. It was very overbearing at points but also i found some points very uplifting + exiting some points though I felt like I saw people walking around as if in a park. There was a park bench and perhaps trees. It was very serene. "
"Unfortunately I was very stitch in my conscious, inner-monolouge-driven mind and struggled to relax into the experience. I left an enormous amount of bodily tension and energy throughout. I take lisdexampetamine for ADHD and that often puts me in a very lucid and though driven cognitive state which I think was responsible for most of this. I have a very active mind’s eye and am very interested in psychedelic culture and experience, it was very ______ to me, but in this I actually found the lights distracted from the clarity of what I was seeing, which was a shame. The pattens I did see were brilliant they were just frustratingly hard to focus on. "
"At first felt overwhelmed and a little bit anxious. The darkness made me feel unstable and exposed. When the lights started to flash I’ve seen lots of colours and patterns (from beginning mostly white crosses in a red background and moving blue circular patterns) and I could feel my eye balls moving. It felt like lots of things going on and I wasn’t sure if I’m ready for it (in sensory way). I took few deeo breathing to relax and open myself to it. I started to see explosion of colours and beautiful patterns. I never experience something like that before. It was intense but amazing at the same time. Infact I felt peaceful and relaxed fast strokes of bright blue, peach and yellow with pastel - the patterns followed the music and I followed them. "
"
I can draw but I coudn’t draw what I saw it was complex. Formulation, codes intense colours, like scientific formulas but I’m not a scientist - I am dyslexic though. May be this has something to do with it. It was a geometric rollercoaster but at times this would stop and I was in coloured water with bubble floating to the surface. Dominant colours were read often i saw the most geometric shapes and almost like pulses or electric route connections this would fade to blue and green. I saw every colour, though including cense? Pink with white and black 
"
"Intense & overwhelming feeling of peace while feeling like rises up out of water ito bright warm sun. Bright colourful kaleidoscope patterns with the vague outline of a city skyline moving behind them, like floating through a multi-glazed window from a moving train. Felt the sensation of moving forward while sinking gently at the same time. Had a very cathartic cry. "
"Rapid, jittery patterns through my vision. Twisty and swirly worm holes. Flying though tunnels, then without warning a chessboarf flashing white and black. 
The waves, red and black through my eyes like a bolt of electricty. The triangle pulling in unqual directions. 
"
"
I found the colours warm and saw mostly sparks and rainbows. At periods I saw only solid blacks of red/yellow and pink. When the yellow/orange filled my vision my face and entire body warms remnant of a summers day lying int the sunshine. It was very peaceful. During the most intense periods I saw dots and zig zags and felt like pulling away
"
"
It feels like in the transformation to be a cyborg undergoing some surgery to be a intergrated with some metals and cyberneties to become a cyborg. Sense of physical body is gone being replaced by a powerful feeling of a superpower. 
"
"The experience was slightly uncomfortable at first. Then very relaxing once I settled in.
Felt like travelling through a black hole. 
Strange how the mind tries to understand the randsom forms it sees. Cubes, honeycombs and sun flares in a desert. Saw rooms filled with small figures, lights, bouncing of heads. Moving from blue light to red then blue. Created some amazing visual effects. ____ Movement. Ripples in a ___ sun scattered on a surface. 
"
"I saw geometric shapes of all kinds and combined
Floating in the space must be like this
Now im tyring to connect with my feelings, and I feel peace which is something that I needed from my troubled mind
Sometimes I feel like crying, but I can tell that the feeling isnt crying from sadness
"
"Intimidated my the complexity of what I saw. Struggling to make sense of what was happening, yet unable to fully let go and allow it to occur. Discomfort has never felt so embracing. The brain does it best to make sense of its experience. Nothing actually happens. The brain just rationalises it like it does. "
"See - constellation with blue or green stars/ spirals roses, oblong shapes
Think - how is my brain seeing all these different colours!!! In the moment didn;t think about the outside world
Feel - intense to start but once my mind got used to the light I relaxed + let my brain enjoy what it was seeing / feeling. Music was very relaxing + then empowering 
"
"A deep released of love, warmth, and protection from my maternal grandmother. As if going back to her womb. Knowing that my aunts, uncles and cousins were created in the same space. I felt her happiness and joy from our recent family reunion. And her love passing though to my children. "
"Sunlight. Eagles, Lighthouses. Intensity, Depth, Travelling. Clarity at the centre - an image of something that I couldn’t quite make out like a person or a landscape. I was aware of the pain across my shoulder the stress. Wild geometry. The was the light reflects of clear tropical water. A real intensity. Eyes. "
I felt light vibrations rather than just seeing them. Enormous energy. Feelings of floating in outer space and the sheer inpercivable speed of light. But it was almost percieable. Thoughts of being a baby + being held by Gran. Could see her holding me with a lot of love and hope. Perceived endless planets of space matter orbiting/travelling through space. Felt the sheer power of space and the thick dense energy that surrounds and is within us. Though about our brains electrical impulses and internal vibrations and the similarities between these vibration and light vibrations. Similar but different. Equally powerful. 
"I thought this was the closest ive come to the perfect way to experience music. 
Sound light your brain and your body all participating in the same process. 
Absolutely fantastic. 
"
I felt an expansive feeling of being weightless with a sense of calm and serenity. The lights and music created a space of kalidoscopic waves of colour making me feel a sense of joy and uniting in my mind. 
"Constantly moving geometric patterns, that moved between moving towards and moving across. Moments of calm. Dots like optical illusions. Retro space game tunnel. "
"Unreal & out of this world. Head felt like it was overwhelmed by shapes and lights. Lots of different Shapes, symmetrical & beautiful. Different colours merging together. Head feels quite overwhelmed. "
"I was inside a rapidly spinning globe, which changed direction often. Occasionally it froze and crystalised shapes which changed colour and focussed the mind. I drifted in and out of slee a little."
"
Blue when the piano came in .

Transcendental psychedelic visuals manifesting themselves as abstract shapes - eyes, hearts, insects, buildings, like continuous journey.

"The dream machine experience made me reflect onhow much of myself I present to the world and in turn, myself. "
It was unlike most things I have ever experienced but reminded me most of clubbing in the 90s in the acid house era (without the MDMA) 
"Safe to say im photosenitive! But it was an amazing experience. The colours!! It was familiar but unlike anything I’ve seen. Cobalt blue stars & hexagons and, loved the soft all over oranges and reds. The flashes were so much for me so I don’t know if the mask impacted my experience it became quite bold & to the beat. Like a heart beat. At one point I thought it was like being whisked in a lovely crome bowl. Reminded me of my gran making scones. Nice to experience as a part of a group - I felt safe and taken good care of. "
"This is my second experience of dream machine. My main observation of difference between both experiences (the first being one of the most profound experiences of my life) This time the shapes and patterns I was seeing this time were multi-dimensional. Last time most geometric shapes were 2D. But this was 3D or more. 

An increased perception of dimensions of objects, like there was more to perceive but I don’t have the machinery yet to perceive. Like that type of perception needs to be developed. Less vivid experience in some ways, because there was a lot, focus on trying to understand what I was seeing. This allied me to see depth. A few patterns remained consistent, honeycom, but it has solid formulation 3D some with star/snowflake 3D
"
"I felt different depending on the colours I could see! The red at the beginning of the experience was very intense and I felt relief as it gone more to a more dusted pink. The strobe lighting was quite agitating in my way, but then I fell down into a sort of vortex of colours. The part I loved was at end where it felt like I was immersed in a lovely deep blue, so relaxing."
"Everything I experienced was characterised by a great deal of symmetry but very complex symmetry. At the centre of my field of view I often saw something circular or even a vortex, but on the fringes were many racing line, electrical. The colours were mostly limited to reds, yellows (when the light was brightest) and blues purples (when the lights were dimming). I did find interesting that I could “turn off” my mind eye whenever I wanted or by slipping into a daydream, unlike the comparable visual effects of psychedelics. I also found it interesting that I could still feel sleepy (and nearly fall asleep) in spite of the intense stimulus. "
"It’s hard to describe all that I saw. Mostly intense colours, bright red, orange, pink yellow, 1 at a time. The flickering light produced swirling, spinning sensations, in that the colours were spinning white, red, green, blue. Sometimes I saw squares in red moving toward me. Lots of wheezing patterns. At 1 point I saw an eye, a closed, a closed eye + brow. Another time a hand reaching up. Another time I saw a girl being pulled up through a trap door by someone. They were just outlines as if drawn + animated, blues, reds, greens, pinks (the lines of them). At 1 point I saw a spinning chocolate cake, ( a cupcake) and the brown bled out in line into the space around it which was white, wavy lines. It became purple lines bleeding into the white, a flower, it became a flower. At times I was in a soft white padded room, like a sensory room relaxing. I saw many different swiling patterns and spinning colours. I saw pixels like 8-bit video games. "
"I saw lots of colours and patterns. Some overlaid on top of each other like a magic 3D picture. The patterns changed depending on where I positioned my eye. I saw multiple colours and at times felt like I was moving (mostly spinning). 
I felt mildly anxious to start with and when the music hit a crescendo because of the speed the images I was seeing moved out. After a while I relaxed into it and mostly felt very sleeply. 
I found it difficult to switch off and focus on the experience 100% but when I did the clarity of the images I was seeing was vastly improved. 
The creaking floorboards of people moving around was a little disturbing 
"
"Nature. Trees passed a car window. Butterflies. Lots of butterflies erupting into a sky. Rain. A bird. Flowers spinning. An eye. In and out of focus. My attention drifted in and out. A black out would wash over and bring your focus back. Felt like drifting in and out of car as a child, watching shapes of trees and lamposts and sun darting in and out. "
I felt like I was flying through an ever changing kaleidoscope of geometric patterns that were constantly rotating and shuddering. These would build in intensity to burst into bright white light then safe to black. It would then begin again with a brilliant blue and white pannel that would shift into different geometric shapes patterns. 
Lots of orange and green. Felt a few times like I was travelling through a wormhole. Times when there seemed to be fillamints attaching the colours to the spots. Felt relaxed. Seemed to be over very quickly. 
"Single strong bright colours in Red, Orange, Yellow. 
Lots of grids - fine lines - some symmetrical then breaking up - Fast movement of patterns like being inside a sphere. Some like water flowing. 
"
Felt like I was in a kaleidoscope 
"
Very relaxing and didnt want it to end. Kaleidoscopic at times.

I felt so out of body - as though I was swirling / spewing into 0 gravity. Toward the end it felt that my body was moving involuntarily. 
"A mix of wanting to fall into it and distraction of daily life: When in my head, the picture was dark (thinking about work). 
Otherwise circles, squares and lines in patterns & grids mixed between floating yellows, purples & aquas as if in a sponge underwater.

"After initial anxiety, I embraced the expeirence + felt like I had esaped to another world. "
"1st sense was of daybreak with the sun coming up - orange glow actually felt as though I could feel the suns warmth. Then various shapes, pulses, movements lots of different colurs - I think I saw every possible colour at some stage - remember a lot of red/green combinations and lots of little fine line black matricles. Shapes moved and floded. I tried to see if I could get them to change direction but not possible. Very flight motion sickness at times. "
"First 10 minutes my mind was racing and as an experienced mediator I thought this was very interesting. Then I began to experience extremely profound thoughts and ideas about my next career move and my professional ambitions. Amongst these profound thoughts, realisation and ideas, I shed some light tears, and also once I got to the point of letting go of the anxiety, I started to giggle briefly and also felt and vibrating sensation through my body which I can only describe as being on hallucinogenic drugs."
"It was a deeply moving and celestial experience. A deep feeling of contemplation. It filled me with profound joy and also sadness. The shape of the room seemed to change - sometimes low and then very high, as though the light was coming through a shift high above"
Moving inwards or outwards. Started from my awareness of my eyes and face and then moved on. Lying on the beach and moving out/in loss of gravity / floating feet

Floating through fractal landscapes + textures. An amazing shift in visuals as the dynamic range of the audio intensified. Very visual + immersive. Excellent experiences. Thanks
"Reflection of my childhood. Pure and innocent the piano was perfect, I almost started to cry. I used to spent almost all my spare time when I was younger at the ice rink the ambient music helped me remember how free it made me feel. When it finished, I felt my whole body had been through a positive & healing experience. "
"Hard to choose which of the myriad to choose. So many colours lots of tunnel and moving -
Geometric patterns feature strongly - wonderfully relaxing.
Soothed my pain which has not reacted to anything chemical - only the sea visually soothes it.
Warm therapeutic feeling - Sun heat. I want to do this everyday. "
"Kaleidoscopic, flip book of fractal and spectral visuails. Mostly consisting of red/white/blues but then expanding into greens/oranges/purples. Some spinning patterns, some scrolling patterns and pulsing visualisations. Especially effective when synced with audio ‘......’ - phase and filters. A really enjoyable unique experience."
"Most of the time was a lot shapes like stars. Moving around in a circle. At times it felt like a person in front of a tall yellow building like behind a sunset. It also felt like you were close to the sun, made me nervous slightly. But mostly a euphoric feeling and that I was safe. When the music got more intense there. Was one point were it felt like the sort of person I was seeing had long arms. Overall brilliant. "
"Infinitely unfolding before my eyes
Colours I didn’t know existed
Dimensions and depth that I couldn’t have imagined 
Motion and movement in endless vacation
Profoundly peaceful and exciting at the same time.
Tools haven’t been invented to accurately render it.
Language doesn’t exist to accurately describe it. "
Intense and relaxing at once. The lights portrayed a pattern which synced with the music to illustrate what the sound would look like. It felt like no one else was here and it was only me. I felt like there was no time or constraints. I could control the patterns if I moved my eyes. 
"I just felt as I always do, I embarked on a spiritual quest many years ago and this is basically how I live my life most of the time - In my own little faerie world. 
Peace and love to all and I hope you plant a tree whoever reads this.
Phantom plant a tree, plant without asking permission. Just like the squirrels - Go on be a rascal. "
"Felt calm, then occasionally 
Anxious then small periods of
Sleep.
Did not see colours or images.
Opened my eyes and watched the light change. Enjoyed when it was a deep red/orange.
The chair was uncomfortable (I have lower back issue). So this might have made it difficult to concentrate or let go. "
"Deep listening experience. 
Weirdly, I seen more when the DreaMachine was in complete darkness. I found it easier to immerse myself in the sounds and let the whole thing wash over me. I felt lots of things. Hard to put into words, but thats part of the experience. Not everything can be, or needs to be put into words. 
I feel like, as a meditative experience it was great. I don’t think enough people get a chance to experience. Meditation in such a personal way and I think this is a great way to bring meditation to new audiences. "
"I felt connected to my own soul, god and the divine. I am part of all and all is a part of me. We are all connected and we are all one. 
It is time for humanity to evolve, to remember who they are, and why they are here.
We are here to love, to learn, to grow and evolve.
We need a mass shift in human consciousness if we are to make it to the next level.
Go within, reconnect to your own soul. 
Meditate and pray.
Give it all to god. 
Namaste."
There was a centre point in my vision where all the bizarre patterns came from. It is almost like a source point. It is always there but it becomes clearer. There were different levels of intensity which could be accessed depending on how focussed I could get. It was difficult to achieve this focus. I wish I was able to get into a better dissociative state to get more out of it.
"I felt mostly totally relaxed and calm.
It gave me time to reflect on how rushed and pressured I normally feel.
It took time to relax  and keep relaxed but it was a very welcome break from pressure!
Felt a constant pulse (gentle) almost womb like.
Felt unnerved by the louder grinding, mechanical sounds almost ¾’s of the way through. Was glad when they receded. Loved the changing colours of the dome - often when feeling a little sad the colour would lift mood.
Cosy womb like.
Am in awe of the talent that created the music and the ambience. Was sad when it ended. 
Thanks to all, a very wonderfully uplifting and refreshing experience.
P.S I need to do it again… not to critically analyse but just to relish the experience."
"In the beginning I just ‘......’ above the natural plants on earth, the grass, flowers, growing, in very detail view. 
Then I just started to think about my friends and the people I met a few weeks ago. Some potentials and things may happened in the future with these people.
After that I feel moved to the universe. I can feel the power of the sun. And even felt the temperature. The warm of it. I felt my body become light and flying in the universe around the sun and felt the wave of it. 
At last I just felt cold, the environment get quiet and the temperature reminds me in a cool space. "
"I felt connected to everyone and everything. I saw myself as a beacon of light upon the earth sending out a signal up into the cosmos and sending a wave of energy, like a vibration of love and colour to blanket the earth. I felt the presence of god. 
God is calling us back to him.
I am filled with a sense of awe and wonder at the sheer miracle of life and I have no words to describe it. 
I am god."
"Alarming when flashing quickly at the beginning but your eyes accommodate.
Warming when the light glowing - reminded me of being on holiday, lying on the sun lounger with eyes closed + sun shines brightly. 
Felt like my eyes were open + I was actively looking around at images - but eyes were closed - weird…
Felt like at times shapes/images were rushing out of my eyes and at other times they were rushing towards me. "
At first I saw images of human cells dividing which seemed a coincidence since I work as a junior doctor! Then afterwards I saw recurring images of flashing colours all converging in the centre into a tunnel. I also saw shapes + patterns of various colours which I’m finding quite difficult to put into words. 
"Feel like open another ‘eyes’ to see the world. Everythings are clear at the first moment, then all of them became blur very soon. 
Feel super relax when feeling white light increase. 
‘See’ slow motion as the music become slow. "
Community with the dead - closeness and peace 
"Relaxed 
Made me smile
Look forward to the day
I liked how it wasn’t warm it was quite cool temperature wise. "
A sense of internal warmth and very content. Towards the end I zoned out and did not want the experience to end. 
"I saw lights, flashing white and blue and red light points.
The last light was quite flash light, hurtful."
"Saw lots of shapes in a blue space 
"
"
Single strong bright colours in Red, Orange, Yellow
Lots of grids - fine lines - some symmetrical then breaking up 
Fast movement of patterns like being inside a sphere 
Some like water flowy 
"
"After initial anxiety, I embraced the experience + felt like I escaped to another world"
"I felt disappointed, sad that I couldn’t go free of myself into it. I liked it better when it was darker (even with my eyes shut) that was a relied. I liked the beat of the music - something to hold on to. And the keyboard was better - was getting annoyed with ______ of the sane. Thought of being at the ___ memories of being at a health spa with my mum - sort of formeless music - sad infinetly sad. Dissapointed that I can’t find any joy anymore. Telling myself not to be so hard on myself. "
"A journey with a strong feeling of sunlight. I moved as much as I felt things moved towards me. Intricate patterns, like an escler drawing, with some of the outlines a very bright intense light. The shapes changed to become amorphous & to pulsate. At time there almost pictures of things rather than shapes but would transform back to patterns. A positive hopeful journey. A feeling (sound effect) of the sea. "
"Sunrise. Followed by dancing burdles of nails (salt crystals?) - them into a pulsating cross with drawing in diagnols, pointing inwards toward clouds, ____, mountain. The colours shift from - blue (electirc) or red or green. _______ Quite dizzy afterwards a bit of a trip. Thanks for the experience. "
"I saw shapes patterns, burning eyes, positivity challenging perception. "

"I saw lace. White and black patterns. Some colour too, mostly purple, blue, green, yellow. It felt like my mind was bending - its hard to describe how. I felt weightless and yet heavy at the same time. After the experience I had this intense need of wanting to be alone and quiet. I felt calm. "
"Visually, it was like going through hyper-drive (or the strange bit towards the end of 2001 Space Odyssey,’ before Dave - the sole remaining astronout - ends up in that strange room). Towards the en, when the music got a little darke, the whole scene went red, apart from some dark blocky shapes at the lower half of my vision, like skewed black buildings against an apocalyptic sky. Very late in the expeirence everything went whispy blue & black like filgree sea greaa. When it was hyper-drive-esque it was moving very fast, solid blocks of colour in repeating patterns. Almost a little to fast. I was able to relac into it though. "
"Truly a dream machine. I was catapulted directly into a dream, very short ____ airy. I went from one dream to another and from there to no dreams. 
At some point, my eyes didn’t want to be close no more but, I felt I wanted to take my friend, hold her hand, share the happiness.
Then I wanted to draw once in this ____. Half of a drawing two naked ___ one of my short dreams and a blue back grounf. Just all kept on the left. Many awakeness happened during the session, deeply enjoy them. It felt warm and comforting. 
"
"
3rd time, very different experiencing each time even with my eyes shut could “see” the person sitting to my right side. I tried to control the colours with somewhat effect. It was immediate, but the colours that I wanted to “See” (which I hadn’t seen in previous two visits eventually became more prominent. And then I let go. 
"
Found myself seeing more colours (not the ones showing on the ___) this was especially true during the more intense beat of the music. Compared to the high sensory my mind I thoughts tended to wander more and I had to bring myself / my thoughts back from every day thoughts /plans”  unfortunately the experience starting late exacerbated this as I felt conscious of time - having said that I would have _____ the length of the experience was much shorter than it was there were also points when the music was ‘going through’ my body and seemed to be vibrating in my body. 
"I loved the though I oculd be away from my phone from the start, But after getting into breathing deeply which I found a bit different I found it difficult to concentrate all on just relaxing + listening to music. My daily issues kept popping into my head but then I started getting into the music. When it was gentle, I’d start thinking about being on holiday with my dogs (this was the best bit!) I got goose pimple especially at the faster bit. I saw really nice colours + shapes. On the other hand I felt sadness that I don’t get the chance to stop (or can’t) these days."
"Sound alone seems could stimulate very vey few images. It took a pretty long time for me to be absorbed into “a dark hole”& for only a short episode. Then my mind wandered around. During this short period of “dark & hole” a small blue spot was there in the centre of the darkness. A sense of me going into the spot. But soon the whole thing disappeared. At another episode, a splash of light came from the top or sideway. Again, the episode didn’t last long. The whole process combined such “cute in” \ fafe out episodes. However most of the time it seemed i was there listing to music with thoughts wondering around. Since I had participated in the high sense experience this morning it appeared that flashing lights & solid was more powerful stimulus than sound only. Perhaps it was a sort of “forced relaxation” by the vivid light & sound. This morning whilst it would take much longer & intense to arrive such with sound only. "
All my accumulated dreams came on by one. Swimming in an endless bright tunnel of water or flying in earth within each other. Recently going places with my daughter. Visiting planets. living/being in tropical rainforest. Sometimes it feels very good/living good only in dreams as its not practical. 
"Experience was largely visual although I had short periods of intense awareness where I lost myself “self” a bit. The visual phenomena mostly consisted of geometric shapes, circles and vibrant colours. I particularly enjoyed when both the music & lights vibrated/wobbled together. With a gradual ___ I really felt & was present with this vibration. Thanks to all involved who provided this experience. "
I was so relaxed that I felt like I was floating but my feet still felt tingly. The colours and patterns were so intense but felt magical like I was travelling to a new dimension. Some of the patterns were so mathematical and geometric that I wouldn’t even be able to draw them without a computer. It was one of the strangest but most beautiful experiences I have ever had.
"Like being inside a kaleidoscope, or a magic eye picture or a fractal drawing. Zooming through the universe with ever changing patterns. "
"
Surreal - Connection to other dimensions in a galaxy where there is peace, generosity, prosperity and life beyond what reality is. 
"
I was nervous going into the experience beforehand but felt calmer in the space. During the test time I did not enjoy the flashing and felt Like I was spinning around very fast. During the actual experience I used the eye mask but could still see colours only more dull. It was darker and I felt more comfortable. There were moments during the experience where I felt on the verge of falling asleep a few times and towards the end I felt like I woke up but didn’t know I was asleep. I saw Red in the bottom corners and green/teal in the middle with rainbow stripes geometrically moving around. I had a good experience overall.
Relaxing and no real awareness of length of time within the space very calm but wore mask and couldn’t experience things. Took mask off and saw kaleidoscopic imaging.
"First of all I seen an orange orb that grew longer. Then a lot of colours and patterns. I was transported into a tunnel of patterns, colours, people and old Hollywood ( casinos etc). I also heard planes or helicopters. I was in a water of blues, purples and black grids.
Wow! What an experience.
Colours and shapes were very much most of the experience and some numbers. My favourite part was the old Hollywood that I seen, and also the range of colours and patterns. "
"I feel like this is what it will look like when I die.
Felt like I was under water at one point.
It was like looking through a kaleidoscope.
At one point it was like an alien abduction but a peaceful one."
"The experience was similar to looking through a kaleidoscope, only it featured faces of someone familiar, but at the same time unsure who it was. At times intense and breathtaking to suddenly warm and calm. "
"Relaxing/euphoric
Meditative.
Memories of light Psilocybin experiences.
Sense of refreshment + emotional cleanse whilst writing.
Only realised the effect of the experience sitting down after.

A tie-dye sky
Poured into my eye
Lids closed transposed
The itch I can never itch temporarily frozen."
"Felt safe for most of the experience but towards the end it got too intense and somewhat threatening with the increased tempo of the music.
Really enjoyed it though."
"Intense colours and repeating patterns.
Images sometimes became three dimensional.
Sometimes felt a little too intense.
Colours changed rapidly - sometimes orange and red but often turquoise and blue.
Like a kaleidoscope - patterns closing in and opening out.
Complete relaxation. Thoughts came and went. "
"There was an intensity + vibrancy of colour that was both unexpected + mesmerising. There were patterns in the colours that also had a sense of movement + expansion, with such variety in colour it's impossible to describe or depict in any drawing I could do.
The chalks you had available for me just weren’t vibrant enough for me. Fascinating experience. Thanks. "
"Pink geological formations
A judging eye whom I accepted
Forests of peace
Blue and white grids of order"
"Bright colours reds + greens.
Geometric shapes, sharp like stars
Cosmic spirals, flashes that filled the field of vision. Sparkles that turned to shapes. Fractal shapes and spirals. Mushroomy acidy 
Colours and contentment."
"I found myself getting lost in the patterns + movements. I was able to control the shape + direction of the lights to some extent, so I was experimenting with how much I could influence the visuals vs how much was beyond my control.
I especially liked the warm bath glow of sun, with the after-effects of the patterns fading away with the music."
"Bright yellow light like the sun coming out from behind a cloud. Euphoria and I couldn’t stop smiling at the start.
Travelling through space at high speed. It felt like we were all sitting in a spaceship, maybe in stasis.
A carousel or one of those old spinning movies where you look through a hole and the movement makes the photos of a horse look like it’s galloping. Don't know what they’re called.
Mostly it felt like being in space and I wanted it to last longer and be louder.
Loved it!"
"Lots of colour.
Graphic shapes.
Near, bright lights.
Vortex.
A galaxy.
Thoughts of calmness.
Relaxation.
Focus on the breath. "
"An abundance of flashes of red, white and morphed colours of blue and yellows, spirals forming into tunnels. At times it felt like I could see clouds around my field of view. I notice a huge feeling of calm and peace washing over me now that the session is finished. It felt like seeing colours and patterns. I didn’t know existed at parts."
"
I just felt like dreamachine should never end, I felt so calm and my all anxiety level just fell down to earth. I am just flying through sky and felt so light weight. 
"
"Initially I felt quite motion sick but this settled. At first I had to fight the urge to move/dance but as I relaxed further this settled.
The colours were incredible.
I saw many fractals/shapes which changed. At first I saw mainly blues and reds but as time went on I saw some really vivid greens.
Overall I felt like I was moving through space. I had a real serotonin rush + an incredible sense of well being. 
While I felt relaxed I felt very engaged by the experience. The music was fantastic and really engaged my sense of rhythm + breathing."
"I felt like I was moving through space, like I saw constellations or galaxies flying past.
There were lots of yellows, pinks and blue, and lots of geometric shapes and circles. "
At the beginning I experienced heightened anxiety which quickly faded and I relaxed. Deep blue was the first colour followed by yellow and continued spinning. Then a central blue stripe with white ‘curtains’. There was a central point that moved to the front and then moved further away… but continually spinning.
At times like sitting on a sunny beach abroad. At others vivid geometric patterns multi-coloured like 1970’s wallpaper. A sensation of moving fast over ground (visual) rather than bodily sensation. At points there were solid colours with almost like scratches through them at others it was similar to the opening sequence that marvel use in there movies. 
The speed of the light changes in the taster made me feel a bit spooked and I was nervous about going ahead with the experience - when the full experience started it seemed more gentle and fun - it was as if the light changes were interspersed by times of darkness - as if my brain was regulating its own respite from the speed + intensity of the colour + light changes and it was fun - at one stage there were some big blocks of colour and there was a warm sensation as the orange sunlight appeared. 
"Lots of flashing cubes with bright colours.
Bouncing shapes in time with the music.
Bright white yellow lights dimming"
"I saw a lot more during the few minutes of the taster than in the main event. I saw very little, saw virtually no shapes and only very diluted, vague colours. I am extremely disappointed by the experience as it was very underwhelming and, after looking forward to this for months, I’m sorry that it wasn’t something I can actually quantify. It was meh, a nothing experience for the most part I was bored and often forgot there were any images in front of me at all. The colours I saw were almost all black and white with some red + once or twice a very faded green. The only shapes were dots."
"Like moving quickly through space, with a black hole in the centre, and stars spinning out of it, every colour. 
Geometric shapes, repeating patterns, spinning around each other. A spider-web type shape, along each strand, every colour, like a mini rainbow at each join of the web. "
"Coloured tunnelling. Towards me and away from me.
Lots of shapes with colour - fine sketched shapes or lines.
Fireworks behind coloured tunnelling, 
White sparks. 
Clouds. "
Direction coming in towards was comforting. Rather than the other directions very erratic eyes. 
"Kaleidoscope
Images that I have never saw before or created in my head… will I ever see these again?!
Pale mint green and red together which are colours you rarely see together. 
Space… Ulysses… soaring through all the galaxies!
I feel like you could manipulate if the patterns were coming towards you or away from you.
The music was very binaural and trancy… very relaxing and hypnotic.
Very “spacey”
I felt happy and was smiling throughout. "
"It was like watching a music visualiser.
Lot’s of reds, yellows and blues.
Fast and slow moving shapes moving in opposite directions.
Felt like I was travelling through a tunnel in space.A wormhole!
Lots of imagery that reminded me of a pulsar. 
A central circle with lots of concentric circles emanating off it. "
"I saw people, cities, a tunnel with a word “pile” or “pila” + many colours and shapes and lines. 
I feel quite relaxed."
"At a point I felt myself unweight, as if I was being pulled upwards. I felt calm and as though I am a past something. I was always punctuated by a warm intense orange canvas between periods of mesmeric light. It was an internal experience, not just something I was looking at."
"I felt very soothed, at first the lights were almost blinding, then they stopped being something I was looking at and they were more in my head/internal. "
"Distracting thoughts of work and worry were interrupted by the levels and intensity of the sounds which calmed me and the drifting from worry to calm was remarkable.
I feel at ease and my mind was at rest along with my body.
I feel energised and very awake.
"
"It felt like parts of me were floating, like when you have a dream and you are about to fall except I knew I wouldn’t fall so I was floating above.
I didn’t see anything during the Dream Machine."
"Meditative, calming.
I could spend the whole evening there. "
"Very peaceful, I had an amazing sleep. Feel rejuvenated and relaxed."
"
I felt tired every now and again, but not enough to completely fall asleep. I feel the light getting lighter and darker was a little distracting and it seem to disturb my relaxed mind. Once the light changed it made me feel more awakened. I now however feel relaxed and very tired. "
I felt very relaxed and then fell asleep for most of the experience.
"I just saw light/dark. In the lighter moments I felt good - inspired. In the dark + loud I felt slightly uncomfortable/threatened + became quite hot. Thought a lot about my family - very positive. In the dark/loud I imagined thunder/helicopter coming close.
In the light I imagined being at the top of mountain. "
I did the deep listening experience after the high sensory one so I was able to discern which affected me more. Turns out the audio made me feel very emotional. The lights came in a lot of body sensations like tingles + the feeling of levitating. The sound experience made me feel like I had a silicone casing around me and the sound was just bouncing and hitting it. The colours came in my aura and it really had an effect on me. 
"It made me think about ‘......’ theory of ‘......’, with the released soundscapes. Saw many colours and shapes shift between each other, to reveal either certain scenarios that I’ve encountered as well as certain scenes and experiences that shaped my psychology.

At some point I thought I could feel the energies of other people in the room and their various presences. Felt like I saw some of my schedules too. Shapes, figures and mirrors saw me going from one scene to the next."
"I watched the world population in green, then the blackness of nuclear war.

Desolation and a helicopter hovering."
"Multicoloured kaleidoscope, not always symmetrical.
I could feel vibrations in my forehead and at the end I was pleasantly tingly from top to toe.
It was also strangely warming throughout like the sun was shining down on me."
"I saw a yellow tunnel with lots of triangles all ponting ahead, it was directing me forward and calming. All in yellow. "
"At the start, I was aware of my breath. The guide told us to breathe and hold. I followed this after she left. I held my breath for a long time until my fingers and lips were tingling and there was red on my eyelids. The music took us through a deep underwater cave, with dripping water. The ripples hit the edges and came back towards the middle, glowing green. And then out again. A green pulse that then started to shrink into a tunnel of yellow. Then I noticed my breath. The next thing I noticed was a helicopter circling overhead, sending down angry, malevolent red beams. Searching to find us. It finished in a verdant, green garden, with maybe bird sounds. "
I felt like I was going into space. I feel so relax.
"At first was warm white light, slowly moving with the music. Moving into a kaleidoscope of colours and shapes.
Seeing blue, white, red, green, orange, mosaic of boxes. And lines.
When the music flowed so did the shapes and move to the sound of the music - flowing across my eyes like a movie. 
What came to mind was shapes that I had seen throughout life such as Inca symbol, men symbol and cross symbol (showing different beliefs of different cultures)."
Like I was in a colourful desert. Floating above looking down at a vast red and orange desert. Spinning shapes. Moved to the sounds almost like a car racing around a track. Didn’t seem to last as long as it actually did! 
"At the beginning I found it hard to relax. But once I found my breath and embraced the experience, I was able to relax a bit more. My hands and feet went numb and I could feel tingles over my body. At times I found it difficult to switch off my mind and wanted to open my eyes. Towards the end of the session I was really relaxed and I felt like I was on a beach. I could feel sand in my toes. The vision then switched to that of a forest. I felt at peace. I could see an eye through the changing shapes. The music changed and I felt love and at this point the eye changed to a heart. "
"Wow, happy, warm, magical"
"It started off very intense, unsure at how I would be able to manage with the full immersive experience. As it began everything was so strong, the colours being striking block colours, the movements sharp + crazy. At one point I felt my eyes open slightly like they would as if I was dreaming. It was from that point my experience changed. I felt my eyes almost roll back and I got comfortable with the process. What I saw began to change. Things no longer felt close to me, the movements changed with the tempo of the music, changing direction or patterns. Colours became more complex. Seeing rainbows and no longer just similar colours together. "
"At the start, I saw more square, hexagonal type shapes with autumnal reds and sky blues. These shapes had very ‘......’ lines and the colours had distinct edges. I felt comfortable, calm, relaxed as the journey progressed. I thought I could see an eye it moved towards the middle of my field of vision, it centred and a spiral shape started to grow from the centre. I felt I was able to control the direction of rotation and the location of the centre/focal point.
When the music calmed and lights steadied, everything went wispy and it appeared that there were two layers or more ‘......’ front layer and a wispy back layer moving differently."
Very comfortable. Blocks of colour shifting into fractal shapes. Loved the music. Reflective and emotional. Found it difficult to keep my eyes closed at times. The experience massively exceeded my expectations. 
"Very bright colours. Mainly orange, pink, green.
Shapes and patterns, squares continuing."
"Fractals
Stars
Layers
Yellow and pink glow
Tree shape in the periphery
Worms +swirls
Black kaleidoscope"
"It was as if I was a traveller in time and space - moving through the cosmos in a leisurely manner, taking in the infinity of all around me. It was the vastness of space which was central to my experience. This, in conjunction with the myriad of colours, focused the mind on how insignificant we are in the scheme of things. "
"Symmetrical patterns, colours changing according to the frequency of the flashing light. Cellular and linear patterns created in different colours.
Certain frequency of flashing were intense and slightly disturbing. "
"Brilliant oranges
Greek eye observing
Shocking intense pulses of white light
Beautiful yellow roses"
The word croatia.
"Pure healthy
Lights turning into all chakras and wonderful healing calmness.
I nursed my father for 5 weeks last year as he wanted to die at home. It was a difficult but precious experience and I  felt his presence strongly during this session. I felt he was at peace and sending healing energy my way.
Thank you for this experience.
It was wonderful.  "
"Bright lights
Spinning circles
Dark holes
Red squares.
Like being in space.
Felt very calm."
Felt like I was experiencing creation. An initial bright light followed by an ever growing sense of speed and build up before a sudden sense of contentment. 
"Bright colours solid, then moving, sometimes spinning or sparkling. Like an African sunrise with trees. Sometimes like a tunnel. Looking up at the sky, clouds blowing across.
Neon lights. Almost like fireworks.
A kaleidoscope of colour and fractal patterns, moving.
I thought I saw a bird at the end of a tunnel. 
It was almost overwhelming.
My eyes were flickering and streaming with tears. "
"Pulsing, fracturnal, exploding colours - magenta, hot pink, orange, yellow, green, blue purple. Smashing, melting, fading and pulsing into one another. It was like a living fractal. It was intense and hypnotising. I wanted to open my eyes and make sense of what was going on, but I knew I’d break the spell if I did. I was pulled into wanting to see what was going to happen next - what colour, what shape.
I kept wondering what was happening, what was making this happen, but at the same time I was pulled into just wanting to be in the moment and experience it.
Right now I wish I had a recording of it because it’s one of the most amazing, breathtaking, mindful, now experiences I’ve ever had! Wow!!"
"Fractal patterns, mainly random around the edges but gaining structure towards the middle with one or two exceptions where a regular uniform pattern occurred.
Observed several patterns hexagon like ‘......’ like flowers with vivid colours, red yellow orange were very common some greens and blue purple towards the end of some displays before fading.
Might have been overwhelming without the breathing exercise beforehand and during the experience."
"A broad range of colours + patterns.
Sometimes I feel like I was travelling through space.
Colour intensity was extraordinary - so vivid. 
I felt extremely relaxed and detached from reality.
At points, especially in the beginning I wondered if the movement of the patterns would be too fast and intense for me, but I think my brain settled into this and I became more comfortable.
The music was beautiful and I enjoyed feeling the vibrations of the lower frequencies in my body.
My husband is wondering if we could get one of these at home!"
"Enjoyed the darkness. The sound system is incredible. I want to know the make - lol. I want to buy it. Was like being at the movies. Tried to relax but found this difficult as the room had a lot of strangers - so fight or flight was engaged.
I’m not very creative, so lacked visions other than ‘......’ colours popping and coming in and out. "
I feel very relaxed and chilled out. That's about the height of it!
I felt a pressure all over my body. Holding me back in the chair. My hands and arms felt heavy. I felt as if the sound was healing my body. I have a trapped nerve in my neck and I could feel that whole area relax and pulsate.
"Memories of the past. Family on the beach.
The universe at night. Time passing by.
A ‘......’, lovely time."
"It took a few moments for me to feel the sensations/relax.
Once I did I heard singing deep within the music. It sounded like calm women’s voices telling me to “heal yourself” + “It’s okay”. I heard mens voices singing “you can do anything”. I felt like I was floating off and then I saw a large wolf/dog-like creature. All objects lost their definition + became blurry. I felt very calm + followed the animal to a path which was warm + relaxing.
I could have stayed in there a lot longer. It was very peaceful. "
"Memories - happy - friends, family, festival.
Full park, sunshine, people."
"I seen a rainbow of colours and in the rainbow was a person, a figure with no details of face or body. Just the outline, but it felt like I knew who it was without seeing their face. They were surrounded in beautiful bright colours after that: seen the stars like I was travelling through space. "
My mind does not let go. Mind still racing. But panic set in to let go and go with the flow.
"I saw the blue sky, the ocean, saw the big “hard sun” + Eddie Vedder singing I felt connected, a drop in the ocean, a grain of sand, a tiny part of everything I felt very peace filled, relaxed, comfortable, I wanted to move, (was afraid you would think I was calling for help).
I felt I could sit here forever.
Thank you."
"Going through spaces, seeing waves, patterns, like travelling through the cosmos. Seen facial patterns or shapes of heads which then changed shape."
"Felt like travelling through space + time. Experienced different colours and shapes, also felt at one point like I was travelling in a different city. "
"Completely relaxed. Heartbeat slow and calm. Feelings of anxious gone. At peace. The outside world can wait.

The beautiful yellow and pink lights took me black to the amazing sunsets of Rhodes, Greece, where the sky is filled with a mixture of yellows, pinks and blues. The waves gently crashing on the shore. My happy place!!

Thank you for taking me back."
"In the beginning I was walking through spaces that felt familiar, then it was unknown areas, but places that felt relaxed, the forest, the ocean and then the desert.
Things got more abstract and I was walking on moving shapes, then I entered into a spiral."
"I seen my hands and I was annoyed cause they had tomato sauce on them and there was 50p which was in like a wooden box and I was trying to get it out.

I drew a burger for context so people didn’t think it was blood on my hand lol. "
"Fractals, travelling boards the light, white, peace and connecting with the light. Felt the music opening the body, cells, and felt at peace.
The journey started and continued. One day the peace, light, music will all be together. 

Travelling like in water or space, no effort in raising and going up, further, higher.
Water or space, made it happening in a faster and faster but without rushing. Towards the end of it. Felt like peace. The rush of going somewhere just disappeared."
"I saw beautiful geometric patterns rushing towards me, rushing away from me + shooting past, like a train, white. I saw Jesus on the crucifix, I saw light in the centre, I saw flowers + leaves, I saw stars flooding the darkness. I saw beautiful blues.
I felt very joyful. I was under the ocean, the sea was above me I saw some letters, but was not quick enough to read or understand what they meant. Nothing mattered. Everything was in the moment there. Then gone, then no need to reflect, just onwards, floating."
"Like being part of the universe. Where we have all come from.
An explosion of colours and shapes.
A star encrusted dark night sky.
Peace, tranquillity at one with the universe.
Amazing experience. "
Lots of geometric shapes - any drawing reflects a moment of unravelling - like vines? A continual unravelling in a symmetrical shape alongside bright flashing lights like stars. 
"There was a lot of variation in the colours, patterns and intensity than I imagined possible. Hexagons, checkboards, a lot of blue and red. At one stage it was so chaotic and intense I just wanted to burst out laughing. I think tears of joy came out of my eyes. It was a magical privilege to be able to have the experience. Thank you. "
Really peaceful but engaging. Very meditative and relaxing. Felt sad at the end. Didn’t want it to stop. Very moving and otherworldly. Felt like lucid dreaming with light shapes. Very memorable. 
It felt strange at first. Almost overwhelming but not enough to want to stop. Everything moved really quickly. I was trying to figure out what the images were but it would switch so fast that I couldn’t. A lot of spinning it felt like I was travelling through somewhere or something not sure what exactly. I saw people travelling on horses but it looked like fire. I saw a lot of fish.
"Multiple black and white, geometric shapes rushing toward me, away from me and across any vision with a core of red, yellow + orange in the shape of a flying raven (sometimes).
At times, the shapes were almost claustrophobic, right in front of my face with a vast expanse behind, with violet stars twinkling.
Then a great red dragon exploded in front of me, leaving an empty universe, a smear of blue in the centre - an earth free to start again, to take another stab at creating intelligent life. "
"Unusual. Removed from reality. Space like.
Kaleidoscopes of colours and patterns. Sometimes specific.
Sometimes not. Brain trying to find shapes or meaning.
Very aware of extreme movement in eyelashes. 
Bewildering. Didn’t feel relaxed. Grounded by the music.
Brain working overtime on that one!"
"Wow, very colourful, very relaxing afterwards.
Colours and shapes that I have never seen combined before.
Like a data pulse stream of information."
"Walking across a beach in the sunshine, water + waves.
Bright sun.
Moving squares, like a path to follow or a slide to go down. "
"Bright orange, yellow and red light swirls.
Patterns, cross, spirals, stars, sea, sunlight. "
I saw most vividly Red circles and blue A mustard coloured background with purple pins like miniature kaleidoscope. Green and blye shapes radiating out from a central point. I felt relaxed and able to “sink into the experience” but was frequently made aware of my situation by a noisy breather sitting next to me. P.S I’m not wearing glasses so cant see what I’m writing. 
"An intimidating journey + on stillness rooting in, still floating "
I was shot out of a rainboe canon into a soft indigo jelly mound 
"Saw some abstract patterns, different colours, yellow, white, green, red. But most of the time, it’s just dark. Fel a bit pain in the left forearm for a few seconds. Sometimes feel relax, sometimes not. No strong feeling. Somehow “waiting” to see my mother who passed away 7 years ago, but I didn’t see her!

Feel the experience was a bit short not enough time to relax! Couldn’t really get into a state of relaxation. 
"
"
Experience was quite and simple, from one side i could forget where I was and in the same time, could see through the universe. I was nowhere and everywhere, space was nothing ______ that I could see. At  the beginning it was scary and fast. My hear beating so fast I was afraid to become blinf. I also sometimes just lose the tracks of the time, and come back in a fraction of second. The colour was sometime like hell and sometime like heaven! True sometime I could thing randomly ____ and thinks or guess which colour would be next, I never get the right one. At the end it was a wonderful journey in my inner world. 
"
"A lot of visual patterns. Yellows, blues, some reds. Hexagonal shapes, zoomin in and out. Bright yellow light. Toward the end I saw my old dog playing in the beach it was a memory. Indeed in th part by the visual stimuli, but mostly i feel though the sound it evoked quite abit of emotion. Bittersweet, I saw him again, happy, playing, alive, but saddened I could only see in retrospect and not experience his presence or company again. There was an overwhelming feeling of love. Interconnectedness "
"Fascinating that white light can produce so many vivid colours. I saw what I can only describe as a reflection in most of the images, almost like I was watching light from a window when interfering with the screen. The sounds + colouts were absolutely brilliant + made me feel really relaxed, almost floating out of my body. "
"Sometimes extreme issues were part of the experience and intimidated into the space. 
Nothing negative in the above. Feeling more relaxed afterwards. Breathing properly helped.
"
"I really enjoyed the experience. Relaxing despite sound of the music being quite loud 
A lot of pulling around an orb that was sun-like. Occasional ‘appearences’ of faces appearing but not recognisable, though there was one instance where I though the face was God.
"
"I felt as if I was moving, falling into something and falling back. Also felt vibration in my chest and a bit of tension between hear and throught that is a bit similar to when listening to music. Saw bright yellow and red, pulsating drops of blue, red and some ______"
"It was intesne but fun :) lots of shapes, like 2001 a space odyssey at a couple points. I saw an eye in one moment as well."
"Potato sun 
"
"In a tube of toothpaste 

"
"
During the introduction I felt slightly anxious, experiencing dramatic ‘pictures’of intense red then greens and blues twisting and swirling intersped with whiter light - darkness. Was I coping with the experience? The main part went so very quickly I wondered if i had fallen asleep? Much less intense than the first introduction. Afterward I felt a real sense of clarify of mind. 
"

"The music and the light become the same, like the patterns created the sound and vice-versa. 

Geometric patterns swarmed everywhere and always had a core centre point like a gateway where they appeared from and went to.

When the light paused or stopped the remaining artistic images remained as a shadow then slowly dissipated."
"A lot of the time I couldn’t tell if I was seeing what was coming to me naturally or what I was consciously controlling it to look like. I saw a lot of geometric and brightly coloured patterns, moving in all directions. There was usually one central point that everything was moving around. 
I saw symbols representing love (heart), Scotland (a thistle - I have just moved from there), and a ceramic patterned bowl full of berries (‘......’ opening a bakery)
It felt warm and comforting and as if I was moving through and being engulfed by it. "
"Lost sense of time.
(Will wear socks next time as my feet (bare) felt cold and it distracted me).
Enjoyed the build-up to full white light + then the strobe effect with kaleidoscope colours. 
I noticed my breathing changing from inhale 4 secs hold 4 secs, exhale 4 secs. Hold 4 secs - inhale 6 secs, exhale 6 secs as that’s the way I usually meditate. I wasn’t aware of any shapes or images but I definitely felt very relaxed towards the end. Would definitely go again. "
"I saw lots of colours + shapes.
However, never fully clearly.
This felt a bit frustrating.
I felt like I could almost see more.
I loved the music + the relaxation.
Sometimes I had to remind myself my eyes were closed.

Overall I felt like I was in a kaleidoscope.
But I was seeing with blurred vision.
I could not see clear.
Lots of colours, some shapes.
I feltI wanted to see the shapes more clearly."
"At beginning I felt fear of flashing lights.
Concentrated on my breathing method and became relaxed and peaceful.
A cross became the main focus. Then pictures of lovely smiles showing teeth (pearly whites). A small face although fuzzy kept appearing in colour fading in and out. 
Very enjoyable experience relaxing time for me. "
"First time trying the one with lights. I found it very relaxing and easier to focus on being relaxed. As the lights patterns and shapes distracted me from my own mind and things that's been stressing me out. The deep listening one was harder to focus… My mind wanders a lot, especially if I don’t have anything to visualise. Let's see how this one affects my dreams. Totally loved it."
"Kaleidoscope of colour, movement in and out and away
Colours changing, shapes changing
Stars across a galaxy
Amazing combinations of colours
Birds flying across a sky
So many colours, sometimes just one
Like moving through space and time
Across landscapes 
Experiencing dawn
Drifting
Now focused
Relaxed
Now attentive
A world of possibilities opened 
Where can we bring colour + nature to our lives
An amazing experience 
Can I do it again?"
"Initial wave of anxiety that once subsided gave way to deep relaxation and warmth.
For the first time in a long time my mind was clear, none of the usual jumble of noise.
Visually a lot of complex patterns and tunnels as I relaxed more I felt like I could control what I was seeing.
Awesome experience"
"The experience felt hypnotic and time passed really quickly. I almost felt as though I checked out for a period of time, almost like I slept through part of it.
To begin with the experience was jarring and uncomfortable but I gradually drifted and relaxed. I saw a lot of blues and oranges at the start, then pink and some whites. "
"Lots of morphing, evolving shapes. Usually in colour, but this colour constantly changed. At times it felt as if I was moving at great pace through space or a tunnel. Sometimes the shapes seemed circular and free moving, like a lava lamp. Other times they were very geometric and mixed in a very consistent way. At points when the intensity rose, I found that I was almost holding my breath, forgetting to breath! I did find it very intense particularly to start with."
"Different colours - very intense
As if I was moving
Pressure on chest - sensation of being on a rollercoaster
Changing shapes
It was both relaxing and invigorating
The wee dots at the end - I felt as if my skin was tingling."
"Felt very relaxed.
Saw many colours + shapes (geometrical)
Shapes sometimes moved in circular paths and sometimes going in and out from the centre of vision.
Though I saw faces at one stage, might have been my own. "
"Intense relaxation. Unaware of time passing. I liked some of the patterns and colours but not all that I was seeing. Just as the thought happened that I didn't like the blacks + reds, the colours changed. Me, or the machine?
Strange , out of world experience.
Would I repeat? Absolutely!
The music enhanced the experience, I know it is an essential part, but it was exceptionally good. I saw geometric patterns, sometimes fast, like pulses, then times slowly. Squares, crosses, spirals, triangles, lines."
"
I felt like time stopped
I couldn’t move my body 
I wanted to last forever 
I felt at peace
I felt the heat from the sun on my face
I felt my heart rate slow 
"
"At the outset of the session the light seemed bright, steady - like a sunny day associated to slow high pitched ‘chimes’ - meditation with the ting of tibetan bells. When there were brief periods of darkness the predominant colour for me was purple - like the crown chakra!
The faster pulsating lights gave brighter images in lots of colours. Many many sided images hexagons to 6 pointed stars. When this would briefly stop there would be more neutral colours in “webs” - like honeycomb often with many symmetrically distributed stripy bodies like bees. 
Grateful of the slowing still white light toward the end like emergence.
Many central ellipses, eclipses, eye shaped images and starry nights. "
"At peace and happy but transported to other feelings throughout. Like is was hard to focus when the flashing of changing patterns colours + intensity was changing so much so quickly.
A triangle where everything was coming from at times like a circuit board of lights chasing eachother. I jumped at some stage not ____ if that was because of the music something I saw or if I was drifting off. 
"
"I could see very bright red and orange lights and then colours of green and deep blue.
I felt so relaxed. It was really quite blissful. At some points I did feel like I was flying, and looking down on the planet."
"Lots of bright luminous colours spinning in a wheel formation. Pattern distortion, no pattern, randomness. I felt like I was watching my own private show but whilst feeling a big energy of the other experiences around me. Through audio I visualised walking, construction, contrasted with spinning circular wheel. When the light faded my vision split apart. 
I also experienced monocrome/greyscale visuals & what static TV is like, I felt at peace. 
"
"The softer the music it became more of a block colour, red, oranges. As the music got louder it became a ray of colours flashing. I felt I was travelling through tunnels of light and wonderful colours."
"I found it difficult to relax at first I was very apprehensive. Then I began to think of death and how this might be at the final stages of death when the brain is shutting down.
Eventually I relaxed and I almost felt at times that I was being jolted out of dream states where for a moment or moments I had drifted off and forgotten what was happening. I really enjoyed the soundscapes and the seating space. The voices were reassuring and I felt safe. The light was uncomfortable at times and made me think about/imagine atomic bomb experiences. I imagine nuclear light would be as intense."
"Mostly like kaleidoscopes- crystal shapes then mostly yellow like the with warmth
Thought about my dads dementia - would it help fix it
Was concerned at one point about being pulled to the light like people before almost dying. Lost track of breathing + of time. 
"
"I had an amazing experience.
I saw faces of loved ones, patterns, and was feeling like I was floating in deep space with supernova or milky way-like structures all around.
In between bright lights looking like someone in the middle. The music was awesome to relax and I had a great time. "
A canyon filled with jewelled pebbles. Navigating through like a ship above clouds no water just millions of sparkling gemstones. 
Saw lots of different shapes. Feels like your eyes are open which is odd but nice feeling. The colours are like something I’ve never experienced before. Very relaxing and music is real calming. 
"Dream-like, Intense, slightly overwhelming, emotional, waves of light + colour, At times it feltliek I was able to control what I could see or feel, other times I was completely out of control."
"Kind of felt like something from Brave New World at the start. Felt like a very space-age trip.
Really relaxing, and cosy.
I saw lots of kaleidoscope style colours + shapes, saw dips + troughs of like a big orb of light."
"2nd time around and lovely. Maybe not quite as intense an experience as before, but perhaps thats just because thre was a sense of expectation of the previous experience. But lovely. Music was wonderful as before. "
The experience was colourful but I felt like id never experienced some colours. I seen a lot of fractals in the style of art from Zimbawae. I seen something I see in my shamanic meditation practises. I keep seeing visions of 2 feet as if they are hands & I dont quite understand what it is my mind tends to want to make sense of things. I do find it hard to let go at times. I kept intellectualsing things. I heard seagulls and waves at the ocean. I felt like I was going in space at the end or landing somewhere. I did not want it to end. It sefo felt shamanic without a doubt. 
"
I seen a lot of shapes. Mostly diamonds + triangles. When the pounds were softer the colours were pastall and when loud more, red, blue, green. I fell peaceful + relaxed when music was intense. And light was flashing felt my hear rate increased. 
"
"Green/red to bright yellow, golden light then sudden darkness to purple + black.
Hurtling through empty sphere filled with stars + then a planet rises + goes.
It reminds me that we are all connected to the universe without + within.
Hurtling through a spinning tunnel of colours so intense. Then a sudden stop + darkness with a central circular image at the core.
It was beautiful, a look at our potential. "
"It reminds of the work of Jose Slyvia.
At 1st I was concerned about how I’d feel with the lights. Then I settled and used it to set positive affirmations. I have found it to be a calming and reassuring experience. "
I experienced relaxation on a level ive never felt before. Grief flashed my mind. I felt in a safe place. 
"Lilac, purple soft colour when the music was gentle.
Red + neon green intense patterns when the music's intensity was high.
Synthesia - when notes of music played there vertical lines of neon pink that popped into vision.
Nearly fell asleep/zoned out initially and had intense emotional memories, then “woke up” again.
Felt a connection to the universe (same as when I’ve had hallucinogens). "
Transportation through thoughts and memories. Some memories i’d never though of since they happened nostalgic feelings. Feelings of summe spring autumn. Feeling of being plunged into the deep dark ocean then dragged up into space then back in the warm light of summer. 
"Very relaxing.
Changing from blue lines, looked like waves/rough seas - small white peaks coming out. Followed by block colours red/orange/yellow with movement - kind of turning.
Squares like crosses coming forward + backwards - kaleidoscope like pinks/oranges/yellows. "
Bright glowing sun becoming brighter and darker then dying off and becoming lost in the sky.
"Always felt in control but 
Don’t feel long enough - felt about 10min long 
Never felt any anxiety 
Wanted to remebe all the patterns
Main colours were Blue + red but also lilac when 
The music calmed
I’m already forgetting my patterns already 
"
"See lots of different colours. Once see all the strong, bright light, white light feel like going to the heaven! But not see the God! Feel joyful! Once, feel something go to both hand & feet!
Once, feel the body is moving, just a few seconds.

Once, feel uncomfortable, a bit anxious, need to go back to the breathing!
"
"Not like “seeing” but rather “in the brain” “in the forehead” Change of music went together with the change of experience. Seems if I wanted not to “see” I could surprising to feel that it was the brain in work! When doing with breathing, it was more relax and didn’t feel an hour had gone. Wanted to carry on but the staff said it was the end. Interesting experience and a taste of the immersive functioning of our brian. "
"I could see different images throughout and changing colours. I felt like there were shadows of trees, clouds coming in and I could see a bright light and rays of red, but then the image kept swirling out of shape and spiralling into different colours and shapes. I could see figures of people around the edges of my experience but no faces. I also felt like I was travelling through a tunnel at points with ever changing colours. I felt relaxed but alert trying to focus on what I was seeing but it didn’t make any sense! - lol."
"Time stood still or did it?
How long was I in the dreamachine? I have no idea.
Did I fall asleep? But if I did how do you sleep with that loud music and lights? Then again it is a dreamachine. "
"During the smoother ambient music the visuals were bright, light and wave-like with an inudalating, close cross-hatched texture. Lots of yellows, oranges and peaches fading to purple and black as the lights went down. The more intense high impact music had  more ___ visual in red, blue, turquoise exploring and evolving quickly like a screen-daver from 20 years ago or visuals you might get at a techno rave. "
"I seen a tunnel of moving lights, as if I was falling through it. It was almost like space mountain (in Disneyland), going through a tunnel of spinning lights. 
I was then in darkness, the light got brighter + brighter + I was floating in the brightest light I’ve ever seen.
The darkness came back but it was blue, blue pixels. Like I was in water going deeper + deeper. It was very calming."
"It was like a journey into another place where there was no need for time or place anymore - the visions were in sync with the music or at least each seemed to be informed by each other. It gave me a great sense of calm and of being in the moment. 
I wish it had never ended!!"
"Most of the images appeared to have the light source from straight ahead, except one where the light was from directly above. There were so many images that I can’t even start to describe them. They appeared and disappeared so fast I couldn’t quite catch hold of them. There was a “default” image that was orange with yellow veins and dark orange flowers.
At one point my right hand felt like it was holding something (but wasn’t).
It was great… I want to go again!!"

"I found this experience very relaxing, I found I was able to focus solely on the experience without my mind wandering to other things. Feeling present and in my body. Like looking into a kaleidoscope. "
"My favourite part was when it was just a solid colour getting brighter + brighter.
When it was the mix of shapes I felt as if I was being pulled through a tunnel of if I was flying, or if I was lying back in the park looking up at the trees and I was spinning round and round.
Often it felt like being in a snow globe with snowflakes falling. 
I felt like I was in a video game. "
"Saw different shapes and colours.
Favourite was orange - very calming and solid circle of orange.
Had a few black moments
Saw a few white snowflakes
Black and red shapes.
Some swirls but cannot remember the colour so didn’t put in drawing.
Pulsing and changing colours and then solid orange circle that was relaxing. "
"Surprised how intense the colours were.
Reds, peaches, pinks, blues, greens, purples and occasionally faded to black + white. 

A lot going on in my periphery vision.
Though I saw cow’s in my periphery. "
"I saw a lot of recurring patterns, blue and orange featured a lot.
I felt very calm, supported, settled, comfort, very warm.
I had feelings of being in a meadow, at a beach, bright summer days."
"I seen lots of hearts, almost in every scene. Lots of purple and red. It was magical, relaxing and uplifting. "
"I started with a lot kaleidoscope images of red and black with a moving centre which the images revolved around, and almost into a train tunnel for a while with lots more blues and purples. It was just a very vivid journey through a beautiful space."
"It was great to lie back and switch off.
The visuals changed… but mainly geometric shapes.
The music carried me along… awesome. "
"Many shapes + colours
Stars
Intense"
"It felt nice + relaxing, I was trying to make simple shapes but everything was abstract. I seen blues, red, yellow."
"So many colours, but mainly orange and blue. When I saw orange I felt warm and the colours were moving like a sandstorm. Almost like you could see the wind. When it was blue I felt cold and saw clouds moving really fast like a storm cloud swirling. Always saw one motionless bright white diamond shaped light in the corner, it never moved. 
Diamond shapes featured a lot in all sorts of colours but very bright + vivid.
Felt really at peace the full way through, very calm and unaware of other people. "
"Kaleidoscope of patterns, places and environments. A journey through different realities and spaces, travelling through different star constellations, quite grounding and life affirming. I also experienced travelling deep into the ocean and the last few minutes I experienced different biological cells duplicating and morphing, I was also consciously thinking about other things in my life but then tried to disregard so I could focus on the experience bu that made me happier thinking about certain aspects of my life for those few moments. "
A constant ever-changing array of colours and shapes dancing about above me. I felt like I was travelling through the farthest reaches of space and time. It was a kaleidoscope with colours and patterns all around. An unbelievable experience to boggle the mind. Everyone needs to see it. The music and the lights working together provided the experience of a lifetime. I will be back.
"Second time doing it.
Saw a lot more colours, with many more different patterns.
Saw more real life images like people butterflies."
"2nd experience of high sensory
Felt tireder and less awake today
So less focussed in myself - drifted off at times - less sense of time passing.
Not so many images
More colours + swirling than images"
"I cried at the beginning.
The shapes and colours are infinite.
My body had chills, goosebumps, not because of cold, but for the intense experience.
I don’t think my brain and psyche are done yet, even if the experience is “finished”. "
"Extra terrestrial experience
Like being inside the universe and music was very relaxing and soothing.
Experience second time around it was more relaxing and enjoyed it a lot more."
"I felt calm, relax, peaceful. Mindful.
I experienced rapid approaching tiny red octagons - that would then spin in a circle and fade to a purple/gold mist. "
"I felt completely rested, even think I may have drifted off to sleep. I could feel my pulse settling and tension falling away and my breathing slowing.
I seen relaxing lights - the swirls like the stars and galaxies, helixes coming towards me. Lots of purples, blues, green, red and yellows. Feeling of looking through a kaleidoscope with different shapes and colours forming. "
"Surprisingly alert and at some points my mind started to wander back to everyday concerns.
The colours that I saw were restricted to the red/gold/yellow group with hints of green and blue at times. And white of course.
I saw patterns rather than images, repeating patterns that seemed to vibrate, contract and oscillate.
It was a very pleasant, relaxing experience shorter than I had anticipated and maybe that was because time passed more quickly? I did not find the music too loud, quite soothing mostly.
What would a second visit be like? Similar or completely different."
"Felt like I was in a deep sleep but also aware of being in the room. My mind didn’t wander as much as I thought it might. 
The colours I saw were mainly red and black during the taster but as time went on they were mainly blue and white.
It looked like a kaleidoscope with changing patterns and pulses. I noticed the music getting louder but found this quite relaxing. "
"I was travelling down a tunnel full of colours in a spiral, deeper and deeper, like a water slide at a waterpark."
"Blotchy rain like patterns.
Strong memory evoked of a childhood summer holiday.
Lying sunbathing under a strong sun with my eyes closed. 
Felt a very isolated/individual time in a universe of sounds and vision."
"I felt so happy. So many colours shapes, patterns - constantly changing and so vivid. I felt like I could control the speed of the movement and direction of movement at times.
At times it was like a kaleidoscope with the most vivid colours and patterns.
I saw a sun, an eye, a mouth and heart shape. 
I was excited and felt I’d never seen such vibrant colours and shapes before.
Felt psychedelic.
At one point I felt like I was falling into the matrix!
Constantly changing geometric shapes, patterns + colours.
I felt really warm and content."
Very relaxing and rhythmic. Lots of colours and patterns changing very dramatically very fast. Constant moving. I felt very calm and chilled out. It was really enjoyable.
A tunnel - light colours moving towards the centre of the tunnel. Lights - small flecks coming from the sides - different brightness. Lots of different shapes but all together. Moving shapes like a kaleidoscope. Like shapes I used to see when I would rub my eyes. I hope I see this when I’m dying. 
"The helicopters! Everywhere.
Zig zagging static of old tv reception. A recurring image of an eye in the centre. 
Geometric and cubist shapes building up and then melting away into one liquid mass. 
Deep turquoise blue with a coral pink which were hatched. The colour combinations kept repeating. -
When the music built to a peak and it felt most intense, I went into the eye and then the eye was everywhere. I could feel this sense of everywhere throughout my body from my scalp to the balls of my feet. My feet felt incredibly sensitive and it was almost dizzying.
Felt calm and floating in final minutes, had to tie myself back down to ground."
"A lot of geometric shapes in concentric circles, but it felt as though there was a centre that was constantly growing. If I moved my eyes I could see other vantage points on the same thing. 
I sometimes wondered if I could choose what geometric shapes I saw but couldn’t work out if I was just “choosing” what had already appeared to me.
A really all-consuming experience. So many colours and warmth! Thank you! "
"At first, it was quiet and slightly nerve wracking but as got into it I seen many different colour fractals but with people in the background. Perhaps a family. I think the beauty of it is that you are left with a sense of wonder to what these images mean? People of significance? Former friends? Strangers you walked past in the street?
Overly, the striking contrast between each mental imagery as the music hit highs and lows creating a masterpiece that I will be left thinking about for some time."
"Felt like I was in a desert lots of cream and orange.
Seen random shapes shoot across at times.
Felt like I was taken to the skies to see lights and shapes shimmer. Only two-three colours per sequence.
Felt relaxed with no movement."
"Once the patterns settled into a rhythm, the kaleidoscopic blend of colours provided a framework for my imagination to unfold. 
I enjoyed choosing a single point to focus on. This fixture then took on a whimsical form and led to great relaxation as it darted about!"
"I felt safe + invited. It felt like a meditative practice. Thoughts of daily, mundane life crept in - same that would normally be anxiety-inducing. But I acknowledged and dismissed them, calmly. I kept smiling. I was hungry when I left."
"Initially preoccupied about opening my eyes involuntarily…
Worried about how bright light would be if I opened my eyes.
Reflected a bit about various disconnected experiences.
Felt ok!
Started thinking about what it would be like to go in routinely."
"Warm yellow, peachy colourred light getting brighter, then fading. The strobe lighting had points of white light, surrounded by red light, surrounded by green light, changing shape, the white centre expanding and shrinking, the red aura and green aura, likewise expanding and shrinking. 
There was a purple and dark red pattern that looked like tartan at first, then like the wavy lines one used to see on the walls of a nightclub. "
"Pinks, oranges, strange colours.
Patterns concentric diamond shapes 
Seagulls.
I saw trees on the horizon.
Changing patterns. Starting from the centre.
Wonderful.
Thank you."
"Relaxed
I think I fell into a sleep.
Reminded me of looking through a childhood toy, seen reds + blues, shapes + lines.
Kept seeing a dogtooth patterned square. "
"I felt like I was going through space during some lights.
I also felt a strong sunlight when the lights became a lot brighter.
During some lights I felt like rain was hitting me. 
I feel a lot more relaxed, as well as a calm state of mind, as compared to entering the dream machine."
"I enjoyed the experience. I mainly seen wheels and circle movements.
I couldn’t move past the fact I was in the room so I feel like I wasn’t fully immersed in  it. 
Mainly felt like I was going through space. "
"During the beginning, the taster section of the dream machine, I experienced almost a visual representation of opening your eyes for the first time. The bright white to orange light felt like the sun on new eyes. Then when the visual patterns came it started to feel like the daily stimuli of each person you meet through one day, the feelings you feel, the things you do. Then it stopped. It started again, it felt like I was looking back on my own life with a new perspective, a contentment that I’m on the right path for me. It was an incredible experience. "
"At first I felt as though I was being drawn backwards through a kind of energy portal or tunnel, which was gradually changing colour and speed. As the experience went on it exploded into delightful technicoloured spirals, angular shapes. I was surprised by the variety of colours and shapes I saw and at times was drawn to a recurring image of somewhere specifically related to my past. This happened about 3 times and has left me wondering what it means. Very interesting!"
"Felt comfort and ease - saw moving patterns that grew + dissolved - triangles, curves. The most beautiful magenta I’d ever seen. Warm yellows + oranges. "

"Extremely relaxed, calm, happy, connected.
I thought about my Uncle Mickey. I saw my new ‘......’."
"A mixture of shapes and colours. Some hexagonal (geometric), symmetrical, others spherical and pulsing. The colours varied. When blue and cool they had a space like quality. Other times it was a bright and forceful red. Orange and greens appeared mixed in with the more abrasive shades which creating a soothing balance as it (......) the searing magentas. "
Discombobulated.
"Kaleidoscope of colours. Reminded me of the interference pattern certain frequencies make on powder (iron filings…?) Hmm? Like a frosted glass window.
I felt relaxed.
I didn’t think a lot. I was wondering if the sense of security + certainty were preventing the experience from taking on a more psychological character rather than just a visual/auditory experience."
"Never felt so relaxed in my whole life. Lots of beautiful vivid colours, trees, snow, and stars, the sun. Enjoyed every minute of it. "
"The colours were so intense, orange, pink, red and purple. The different shapes and colour gave me a wave of calmness. At one stage while the bright orange light I seen the outline of a male figure wearing a tophat. Once the session ended I feel at ease, less stress and very calm. "
Best tangerine dream concert I have ever gone to. I mean this as a big compliment. Very restful and immersive. 
I could feel my brain slowing down and breathing in the light.
"I saw a lot of spirals and as the experience went on I began to feel as though the spirals would move and become tunnels that would open into scenes. The scenes changed and I felt the music and light brought me an ‘......’ array of images.
As the experience went on I lost track of time and when it was over I had no idea of the time passed. It was a relaxing and meditative experience."
"Very excited to involve myself in the experience but had a very subtle reaction - lots of colour from the lights but never amounted to anything happening in my mind. Tried my hardest to relax and fall back into it but to no avail. 
I will definitely try the experience again to see if anything changes - unfortunately the experience just left me annoyed and frustrated but as I say I will try it again. Many thanks."
"I felt weightless and limitless. A singular vibration frequency with the music and environment. Present. Relaxed. Intense geometric shapes when changing from light to dark. Sun, yellow, orange, and red like a burning flame. Peaceful and calm. "

"Seen - a lot of orange light, flashing geometric patterns, constantly moving/evolving in to other patterns and shapes
Thoughts - Sometimes hard to concentrate on the experience when the movement caused too much eye twitching. So kept getting alerted back out of experience as such.

"I definitely remember immediately thinking the word peace, so incredibly calming. I saw a big burst of yellow light and was amazed at the wave of calmness that washed over me. 
I saw a lot of geometric shapes, saw a few butterflies, flowers and hearts. Very cool! "
Swirls of colour water despite moving though the lines/waves. Clouds moving through the atmosphere through a desert landscape. Squares of red and blue getting bigger and smaller. Creating a feeling of sensation focusing on what I see and how I breath. 
"Unawre of what the experience aims to achieve, I experienced great discomfort about ___ way into the experience. The flashing lights sequenced lasted long enough for me to have to put the eye mask on. My eyeballs felt hot all of a sudden. I did see a succession of shapes and colours like if I were looking into a kaleidoscope, but the intensity of the flashing was too much and i started to feel sick and dizzy. "
I saw my granny’s dresser from my childhood. It slid into view + vanished when the music changed. I saw many landscapes sliding in + out. I saw people + masks in the middle of kaleidoscopes. I lost track of time completely. I lost my sense of self while keeping my sense of perception. My POV had no body. Objects moved through me. One day I hope experiences like these will be as popular as fairground attractions. 
"Relaxed
Bright clours - mainly red but some dots of green + blue
No patterns as such - maybe dots. Yellow as if looked at sun too long when bright light 
cloud wispy and grey - rolling in from above at times.

"I’ve decided not to draw anything as a single image could only describe a fraction of the experience; similar to how one sentence of a book wouldn’t describe a book. I saw kaleidoscopes within kaleidoscopes. Any attempt to describe real world objects appearing within these swirling grids would be willing : willing images of the familiar on that which is entirely unfamiliar. All I saw was an almost indescribable mess, which is not a criticism. The closest Ive been to this before is while on psychedelic drugs and trying to get to sleep byt this was much stronger. "
"Intially I felt anxious, unsettled then i started to relax anf got into the experience. I found myself laughing. Found expansive feeling through it, my body weightless. I felt some sadness too, an interesting inner experience. "

"I felt like I was in a space of nowhere and some where at the same time. Like my mind became the backdrops on the old VLC players, when they play music. At times I felt like I became too much “one” with myself, where I did not feel able to separate myself from the outside world. This was both discomforting adn interesting at the same time. 

Seeing and reading that other people saw perceived other things than me reminded me that what I perceive as the true reality is more just my reality that there is no absolute truth. 
"
"I felt like experiencing and exploring the hidden mysteries of the universe, the emptiness of space, observed for distant galaxies, aswell as the joy and beauty of walking through a cornfield and coming home. "
"Relaxing. Saw red, then deeper red during the taster. However, mostly white flashing or shimmering. My mind kept wondering. ( I have chronic insomnia I thought that would affect the experience - I also went into the experience a bit stressed after a quarrel) "
"Gentle soft light then rapid with extreme flashing + different shapes of vivid colours. 
Felt like looking through a kaleidoscope. 
"
"Safe, warm, cosy, relaxed, wonder, curiosity."
"I moved into a space where my emotions felt ‘unwrapped’ and ‘released’ - I felt hurt and pain was released slowly, just like the tears that were rolling down my cheeks — I felt overwhelmed and clocked in a sense of peace. "
"Blocks of blue, like I was in some sort of X-ray
Flashes of red dotting around but not for long or consistently 
Constant sandy yellow background, as if the beach was also in my view.

"When the light levels were lower I experienced more patterned, rhythmic visual displays on the “internal screen” of my eyelids. Felt emotional/heart movement with the variation and intensity of the music/soundscape. This could feel like an emotional crescendo at times. Felt deeply involved in the process. Sedate, reflective feelings after the main process. Has some similarities/parallels with holotropic therapy. "

"It felt like I am in a movie, it was a strange experience, like I don’t belong to myself in any shape or form and my thoughts are not my own. Then I started to see more like a galaxy and space, stars and a milky way and started to think about universe and the meaning of life. At the end I was back to my anxious self and it was hard to distract myself from my anxious everyday thoughts. It made me feel like we are so small in the perspective, compared to the universe but then our everyday lives just take over and everything starts to shrink and feel small. "
"Inner healing of my physical body: I conscientiously thought of my lower back pain and how I can help it heal. An image of my back in bricks appeared there were bricks missing, cracks and the cement holding the wall of the bricks was fading. I focused and started to put them back together, it happened naturally. I expanded my awareness and offered this technique to others who may be feeling physical pain. I saw my dad holding a flower. I saw spiders when the music intensified and they took on hexagonal shapes. It was quite hypnotising, rhythmic and geometric. There was no fear, a sense of freedom washed over me and I felt tingling, no shame.  "

A marvellous time and relaxing experience and mind blowing time.
"Deeply relaxing
Allowed inner time + space to imagine a pure world.
Allowed space to develop a compassionate mind. To take the suffering of others + to give permanent happiness.
Allowed the dissolving of normal concentrated thought.
Go below the waves of gross thinking
A feeling of lightness
Nice to experience this in a holy place.
Delve into pure imagination. "
"A strange space between sleep, hallucination and imagination. I can't work out if I fell asleep? I don't think so, but it was odd. Mostly geometric patterns and ‘.............’ faces, a person dancing, who was possibly my mother? It was full of mystery. The ‘......’ wasn’t entirely pleasant. But having been in it, there was a sense of calm and joyful wonder that I miss already. "
"It was intense, a sensory overload, followed by moments of extreme calm/peace. At times I felt like I was floating + then flying through space + time. "
"Very bright at start, was squinting - settled down into kaleidoscope, different colours changing, blue. - almost grid like.
Don't think picture could describe it accurately."
"Spinning in space, watching the world pass by, deep reflection."
"Very unusual. Reminiscent of colour field art works. I liked the dawn to dusk flow. Felt like journeying in another dimension! Warp factor 8!
I did wish it went on for longer + I’d have loved to have been able to dance with the colours!
Certain patterns were very beguiling. I’d love to know more about the process of creating the imagery behind the eyes!
Brilliant experience! "
"Kaleidoscope, hexagons moving, yellow, red, pink and blue shapes gliding white light."
"Felt like an infinite, peaceful abyss."
"Many visuals - all different colours.
Not as much emphasis on audio
Felt as if I was horizontal when visuals the strongest.
Felt quite short but also enjoyable 
Not too intense - great experience
Kaleidoscope feeling - circles twisting
Blue and red mostly - some nice purple, blue and orange/yellow colours."
"The feeling of calm, similar to meditation. The feeling of overwhelming senses yet being calm. 
It allowed my mind to wander yet focus on thoughts when certain colours came. "
The most noticeable thing was in brief moments I forgot to think. Each time it's happened I was startled by the realisation of the discovery.

"I loved both the slow spaces into rich darkness, slow brightness the fast moving periods. The slow dark spaces felt like deep rich blue & greenish space so much infinite depth. The depth intensities of the blue, the glow of the fine green patterns. The warm orange lighter slow periods so rich and warm. The fast movements I travelled, sometimes the tunnels moved away from me occasionally. I felt the clours move toward me as if I was being immersed. A feeling of delight & joy. Often a focal point of light in the middle moving away or toward me. Sometimes it felt higher up at the pineal gland. Travelling fast, the speed sometimes felt intense. "
"I felt deeply relaxed, shining deeper and deeper, stress descending, breath minimal and deep as if in meditation. The strong still bright at start and end felt really soothing, like the sun radiating down and bathing me in its rays. Then the flashing produced patterns and colours, I think always with a central point which was often a cross or a small globe. I wanted the central point to stay in the centre of my vision, but it seemed to want to move, so I let go of holding on and iy would move around, not drastically thought. I saw many colours - blues, greens oranges. At certain points - perhaps when the flashing stopped - I would see a stray sky and I had a feeling of travelling through the sky. When the central point was there I wanted to travel toward it and go through, which sometimes I followed, other times I let go and witnessed it ____ as I did so. "

"I was flooded with memories of a particular time in my life - actually the period from 1976 to approximately 1980, when I was living in a commune in the South of Spain. A turbulent and transformation period for sure! Names, faces, experiences, memories with good & bad were ___ over each other. This was not especially emotional but it was interesting. Perhaps not that suprising as I have been writing about that period in my life recently. But the memories came ___ and in renewable proportion as if a memory lead had been turned on. In the end I felt I would have liked the experience to go on much longer -the memories were still coming and hand lead to the mid eighties. I even had a feeling of communicating with relatives who have died __________ What suprised me is that this did not evoke a very strange emotion - I didn’t feel like crying. "
"I felt I was getting some small ingith guest visit, the TAO; pre-conceptual reality.
I felt a sense of enormous jou, light (weight) fascination 
I noticed to begin with all the action started/arose was initiated from the centre (cones?) and propagated outwards.
As it went on, I felt the experience became more unified in origin, less analytics (eg tunnel of squares) and more integrated over whole field if view. 
I felt the experience (main) was about 8-12 mins. Amazed to be told it was 22 mins
I was highly alert throughout - amazed at the experience.

Lots of diamond shape. Pulsing and spinning around. Tiny little flashes of blue and green but mostly red and orange and yellow. Darker spots in the middle of shapes.
I felt relaxed mostly but a little bit adrenaline as it intensified. It felt familiar. Or like playing a computer game or watching a movie. I remember seeing shapes like this when I was little & closed my eyes. 
"
It will take me a little while to percolate on this experience & process its meaning & impact. I thought it was going to be longer so didnt relax into it very quickly. Memories and thoughts popped up throughout & I felt able to allow them to come and go.

Like looking at sun then flashing squares with symmetric different colours as goes darken the colour change at one point sense of movement 
"
"
There was a feeling of space, expansive space, and a visceral movement through it. Colour, shapes coming and going - kaleidocopic visions at times intense and at others warm and calming. I felt almost an embryonic state, is this what perception is like in the womb - an every shifting version of what is happening outside and in. i’ll never forget this experience - I was moved and will continue to process this for some time .

I feel more confused than when I went in! I didn’t really know what I was coming to. It’s confirmed my head is a party.

Feel a total sense of calm, peace & happiness. Completely relaxed.

"I felt a deep sense of relaxation, love and happiness. The vibrant colours and shapes seemed to almost represent me. Represent who I am, how I see the world. I thought of loved ones as the colours burst around me, my partner was red, I was blue, my mother yellow and my friends purple. Overall I loved the dreammachine. "
"The warmth of the sun - great joy - a journey across space - dreams - faces - images that formed and faded - not sleeping but almost - state of strange “other”

"Felt like I was floating, travelling through space. Quite relaxing. "
"I kept having the sense of ‘driving’ down a large white road, with white building sailing past. Sometimes the movemnt would stop  and I would be on the couch, seeing lights & silhoyttes that resembled the view from my home.

"Alternating colours - reds/blues/silver - orange/pink/green
Oscillating patterns like a kaleidoscope / riley/ vaserely / apart pictures - when lights were bright 
Northern lights type sheets of green pulsing colour against black when lights were low
Sometimes spinning vortex of green dots at the centre, like a paint of singularity in the black night sky. 
"
"I didn’t like it! I felt like I was in motion at times. There were periods the light was cal, and one colour but I did not like the kaleidoscope and movement sensation. I primarily felt the movement sensation was uncomfortable. I had to move my feet to feel grounded. I expected to feel relaxed but the thought that the kaleidoscope would return made me feel on edge. I wouldn’t rush to return. "
"Fractal shapes, tones of blues, yellows, red, and orange changing sometimes gradually and sometimes at pace with an intensity of light streaming from a focal point. Somepoints the intensity was extreme, while other points it was more gradual & relaxed. The music helped guide the dynamics along with the flickr rate, which fundamentally changed the nature of the experience. Although intense at points, it never felt too overwhelming. A great experience"
The interplay of different colours on my retinas - each differing with the preceding colour. Sound are jyst colours with a wavelength we cannot see.

"Launching into space, feeling the force of the rocket as it pulls the three os us into Earths orbit. Me, my bestie and an unknown future love of my life. Watching the Northern Lights from space, holding hands. Feeling in the moment with LOML; intense eye contact - almost like i’m in an experimental movie. Deep feeling of love, contentment; delight with the adventure we’re on. Would never want to be anywhere else. 
Light shows on the rocket, dancing together in the various - I guess like coloured fireflies. 

Landing on a new planet far, far, away. Feeling the alien ground, plants but thinking always of the love beside me, accompanying me. Three of us watching the sunset as the rocket unfolds into our new home. LOML seemed to know what to eat; all of us picking the fruit from the alien soul. Her talen knowledge - I saw why I loved her.

"This was the second time I’ve done the Dreamachine, and was determined to ‘hold on’ to as much of the experience as possible. I failed. (Again, 25 mins felt like 10 -1 dont know where the other what) Very juddery + unsettled visuals, without being in anyway mutually unsettling. The best bits’ were the breaks, when the pattern field suddenly gave way to something else that looked ocmpletely different - colour, shape + rhythm. A feeling somewhat akin to watching a magician slight-of-hands, knowing that what we are is seing is only part of the story ."

"At first I saw loads of patterns, which I thought was great but I worried it might be a bit intense. However before I knew it i’d been dreaming (acout people not patterns) and woke up and felt like I’d missed most of the show! 
I don’t even remember what I was dreaming about. I’m keen to do it against o be a bit more conscious on the patterns I remember, they were like moving lines, but the line were broken into different colours, and would move in one direction then another.

"I saw lots of colours and patterns - shapes like triangular arrows, hexagons, lines or dots travelling in straight lines or dots travelling in straight lines or out from a centre like legs from a — at one point I seen the shadow of big glowers rotating around behind the lights. I felt very calm and happy, amazed by the patterns I saw. I was thinking can I see images in this because I felt like I could see shaddows behind the lights that weren’t clear and I wondered what they were. I imagined I was travelling through space at speed, watching the stars speeding past me, I thought sometimes it looked like I was looking down on thousands of electric blue ants travelling in little lines up and down and left and right across my vision. And at one point  as if I was going down a whirlpool of colours peed around, although I felt still and safe."
"I saw flashing stripes alternating between either: 
Very vibrant blue and red or muted blue and salmon or black and white
At times my vision would fade to black with the colours fading to a grid of clots that then disapeared. 

I found that my min wondered a lot and I frequently caught myself remembering where i was and forgetting what I had been thinking about. I didn’t feek any emotion particularly.

"Squares featured heavily in what I saw, red, green, blue and purple. The squares were small and spinning in a clockwise direction. They then formed different shapes. Squares turned to circles, spiralling away from me, creating a long dark tunnel, this happened for a short time, but re-appeared throughout. These circles merged into blotches of colours. Green sunk into purple background, which shrunk into the green repeatedly, these colours changed to blue and red. Towards the end all shapes and colours disappeared and it was just black. "
"Lots of sensory feedback from external factors, from chair, warm blanket, suddenly aware of my place in the room. Zoned out of concentrating, increasing and decreasing circles rhythmic and repetitive, the circles rolled from side to side slowly.

At the beginning I found it difficult to keep my eyes closed, as the experience continued that became easier and more instinctive. "

It reminded me of being a child and lying on the grass with my eyes closed and looking at the shapes and colours that I could “see” on (inside) my eyelids.
I found it incredibly relaxing, but also really intense. I found myself smiling at the start. I could see lots of different colours - intense red to begin with and then later darker blues and greens.

Reds, purples, greens, yellows, blues, purple and some point lots of patterns going across each other like lots of crosses going across lines. Then it would change. The shapes were crosses, stars, lines, triangles + squares. They reminded me of the floor in the ‘......’ at the start. The tile shapes. The triangle beams + windows. At one point there was a very orange, red eye, like a dragon or mt doom from LOTR’s? I felt different during each colour or pattern. At one stage in the middle my eye was flickering.

Cosmos opened up! There’s so much. What an experience. "
I wanted/ expected the experience to last longer and be more intense. At first I found the visuals quite/overwhelming. Then I relaxed more into it and let myself just be and feel. I enjoyed dream dreamachine. I feel having came out of the room like I have experienced on intense mediation. I feel very relaxed and peaceful. I have chronic pelvic pain and I started the experience in quite a lot of pain. I could not feel the pain at the end of during the experience. It distracted me away from my pain. 
"I felt calm and at peace then I dreamt or day dreamed 5 times, lucid dreams, random thoughts, then was snapped out but a ‘white light’. The visual experience was kaleidoscopic at some points but frantic at other places. I saw an amazing circular spiral with white and red squares flashing red then white. 

Another was a gradual dissatisfaction into white noise. 
A rush of adrenaline,  lights changed and I jolted out of it as I realised I had been ascending, heart beating faster then calm and diffused white noise agin.

"Intense abstract. Mind separated from body, felt like floating for the first time. 
Audio was incredibly immersive and felt like it took you through a story from being born to dieing and fading into space. Can’t tell if the audio influenced the visuals, but it sounded fantastic - well done Jon + Team

Felt like I was on Doctor who time travelling through time and space.

We cannot control what we see. What we see depends on other senses - context & perspective.

At one point it felt like I was flying in the clouds, then I was suddenly sucked into a wormhole full of red and blue patterns then suddenly into a TV screen, I felt relaxed most of the time but it did feel like my eyes were open the whole time. 
"
"Geometric patterns spiraling and flashing. Trees, colours red + blue, yellow + green, purple + black these flashed and moved to the pulse of the music. "
"Spinning fractals, with bright blues and reds and orange. Mostly abstract. I liked it. "
Relaxed like I was flying through space never stopping.
"
A little nerve wracking to begin with but then I fell full relaxed. A very calming experience. I felt like I had time to breathe and reflect. I felt very euphoric during this experience. Afterwards I still felt full relaxed, calm and happy. My depressive mind left for a while. 
"
Relaxed and weightless. At peace in the moment of the experience. 
"Like flying through space, being in the waves, spinning in a kaleidoscope & staring at the sun all at the same time. "
"
Sense of warmth, belonging, tranquillity, peacefulness & serenity.  
"
It will take me a little while to percolate on this experience & process the meaning & impact. I thought it was going to be longer so didnt relax into it very quickly. Memories & thoughts popped up throughout & I felt able to allow them to come and go.
"Intense, constantly evolving kaleidoscopic, pulsing changing colour. Often repeated patterns. Sense of moving through a landscape sometimes, sometimes more of looking. Layers of coloured light and texture. A feeling of out of body or otherworldly. At all times. Abstract and a feeling of joy an excitement. Didnt want it it to end. 
"
"To begin with it felt like I was going into the light, then it would go dark with little bits of light throughout. Further in seen different shapes and patterns moving, I kept going between the two. "
"To begin with I felt like a creeping happiness before i knew what was happening my face was smiling on its own. My body was happy seeing such vivid colours. Toward the middle, I had a very intense journey. Then at the end it was peaceful, I was underwater on the cornish coast or in a beautiful swimming pool with vivid purple red tiles. My happy place in the water. Floating about making my mermaid scales rattle it was a peaceful, beautiful experience that I am so glad I experienced. "
"A variety of different experiences mostly red & yellow or red and green small shapes (geometric) with a big red and light circle that moved in the middle. Then it was dark - a collection of hand edges circles or hexagons almost like coin, emerging from the darkness. A feeling of travelling through space.

I felt happy when the lights were orange and bright - I remember smiling involuntarily. The dark scenes I felt vaguely unsure - like I didn’t know what to make of it. At the end - almost a feeling that my body was lying down, and I was slightly above it. 
"
"Spiralling geometric shapes that changed pace and collapsed before changing into something new. 
Sometimes I felt I was watching it from far away but other times I felt like I was inside it.
Another sensation was feeling that what I was seeing was actually 3-0 and could be touched.
Really vivid colours, mainly red, blue and then strong pink and yellow. 
"
"I was experiencing lots of different patterns in a sort of order - replaying patterns again. All were moving or rotating in some way - some were more 3D, others were 2D.

My body felt like it was floating and so it was twitching at times. Towards the end the patterns stopped appearing. At first I was searching for them again and then realised that I could see a calming mixture of colours still from this point I felt content and relaxed, and stayed like this until the end. The difference in visuals was very interesting - it went from lots of busy frequent changes to more stillness and excitement. It was all round a lovely and fascinating experience. 
"
"See - it felt like I was in a giant kaleidoscope. Lots of different colours and patterns. Sometimes there were lots of lines and sharp shapes and sometimes there were more soft shapes. Sometimes there was a blue, pink 
Feel -  I was really interested in what my eyes were seeing. I felt dreamy sometimes too, having the odd ‘micro-zonk’ where I had fragments of dreams, eg. a huge robot falling over. Think- I was mostly thinking about what my eyes were seeing and the colours and shoes. A really interesting experience. 
"
"A deep sense of peace, tranquility and oneness with the world, a visual kaleidoscope experience, with changing patterns and colours. An internal conversation with close family mrembers no longer in my physical world. A feeling of harmony of mind and body. A state of complete relaxation. 
floating , drifting, constantly evolving, manic but happy, beyond vocabulary

Red & Blue strong colours with high vol sound.
Orange had words appear
Bubbles of sound with pulsing beat
Solid blue solid red
Very little yellow

My second experience… different to my first experience in that I stayed awake throughout without any involuntary body movement. Shapes were more linear - very curvy in my first experience.
"Didn’t see anything, but did keep drifting best way I can describe is a line, above it I was aware of things, memories etc, then would fall back below it.

Became lot more aware of touch, feeling of lips against teeth was something never occurred before.

"As soon as the bright light - orange and white started with the music I fet that I was back inmy childhood. The sun was shining bright and warm. I was on a bed we used to visit. The image of the mountain and the sun shining from behind it. Table mountain. I could feel the tears and could not stop the flow. The waves breaking the sand. Then blackness with thousands of green ovals spriling, into many other shapes and colours. The sense of childhood lingered with the music. "
Lights slowly rose is a yellow sunrise to a blaze of orange lights. When lights dropped I saw a field of glowing green/blue mist. Ith frequent pulsing music I often saw a cross shaped pattern of red and white “___” patterns that brought to mind interference patterns or waves. Again when lights draped I sometimes saw midnight blue with a ___ of twinkling stars. 
"
Very relaxed, lost in my mind, very much like I was in a kaleidoscope at times, rainbow in centre of what was going on, very seldom one colour, a flung of colours & my mind was lost in them. Wow wow wow!
"
"I felt like I was in a James bond opening sequence. Made me feel peaceful and calm. 
"
"See: Kaleidoscope of colours, the ocean and a beach, people in the distance.
Think: unable to explain how i could see coluors of the lights when my eyes were closed 
Feel: calm, serene, felt people who have passed were present. Felt tingly and as if the chair was massaging me. Could feel myself sinking in to the chair, very relaxed and happy

"I could hear an inner voice saying “I want to stay here” I saw my three babies, standing, rushing away from me into the distance. When I opened my eyes, there were tears running down my face. I was a cannonball rushing through ice on fire, speeding towards myself. "
"A fractured kaleidoscope, like broken concrete in vivid blye + red. Sometimes white would wash all other colour away then fade in to a royal purple. I felt relaxed, building intensity with the music + lights. I felt secure and curious throughout. "
"I saw lattices, shapes, colours, movement, flux, simmering, grain so fine like the noise of light after the big bang - spreading out into vastness - programmed patterns that morphed into dust clouds - dark areas with pinpricks of light. A cosmic rhythm that made me feel happy in parts and in awe of life. "
"
Many different colour twinkle stars. Some of them inside the blue box move to anywhere and shake at the same time.

I felt quite overwhelmed with all the colours I wa seeing and didn;t feel like I was thinking about anything. At first I found it a bit too intense but eventually I felt as if I managed to be completely present and enjoy the experience. 
I felt relaxed and it was fun but I got a bit bored towards the end i can imagine having sex in the machine would be really amazing + a pretty unique experience. I’d definitely recommend it and will be 
"
Wow! Amazing patterns with the changing lights.
Was overwhelming for me. Felt on verge of panic attack which I don't get.
Had to escape.
Reminded me of being in an MRI scanner + felt the claustrophobia I have previously experienced. 
"
"In the space I remembered old conversations, good memories. When I opened my eyes I can’t recall them, but everything led to the water. I felt like I was floating. "
"I saw what seemed to represent the galaxy. A lot of colours, mainly blues, greens, reds + purples. I saw stars, but they were far away.
I saw people peering through what felt like an opening to a cave with water below them, first a female and then a male wearing a helmet. I saw a red firework sort of scene, it wasn’t like a normal firework but rather nice and calm. I felt very calm and relaxed during the whole experience. "
"Not long into the experience, I felt a light touch throbbing in my stomach not for very long then after this in my stomach area I felt heat and this lasted about 10 minutes.
I have never experienced the above before.
I felt relaxed most of the time, with my mind overthinking my life as normal, but a few times I felt a very joyous emotion right through my whole body. I had my eyes closed mostly and I felt the sun shine down on me and beautiful calmness with yellow light."
"Felt very relaxed, aware of my breathing + the music - transient with a regular drum beat. When the music changed, I saw a black + blue irregular shape in my mind’s eye that changed to purple. Also aware of my chatty voice though, thinking about the experience."
"No singular emotions, sadness, happiness etc. Just on overwhelming ‘......’ of my body, muscles, ‘......’ and how it would react to the sounds and lights.
It would be great if somehow use of sub bass sounds could be incorporated into the seating so that is a physical link with the sounds for a more deeper immersive experience."
"I felt the heat of the sunshine and running in the grass to hold my daddy’s hand when I was a little girl, my mum was sitting on a wool check blanket and she was pregnant with my brother. These are happy memories of my very happy childhood. I have 4 brothers and 2 sisters.
My mum died 37 years ago with cancer and my daddy died with covid before christmas 2020. I believe this is my mum and dad still watching over me from heaven and we will all meet again 1 day. Believe. "
"Although it took me a while to relax and start feeling the dreamachine, once it ‘clicked’ I felt a very pleasant experience. I started to see different landscapes, places I have never seen before, and almost feel like in a different world. Also, when the room got completely dark I felt like it was the end of one day (the night) and right after there was a new day starting, bringing new landscapes, feelings, shapes, etc. "
"I am usually quite a close minded person, however the “dreamachine” experience was truly eye opening. I felt emotions that I rarely feel and it was very overwhelming.
I am unsure if what I saw was a real life event from the past, however I felt it was, and it was wonderful in so many ways.
I seen “life” in many different colours however I also felt it.
Would recommend to anyone, spiritual or not.
Thank you!"
"An easing, a transition in awareness - from ruminative thoughts to a syncing of breath and body to, first, an imagined pulse in the music, then, to the slowly emerging one, fixed thoughts began to dissolve. More spontaneous images in my mind, these began to morph and transform into others. Sometimes too detailed-oriented in listening to music, too enlightened, it was easy to get by this by following the gradations of the light, eyes semi-closed. Loss of a sense of corporeality, outside - inside self. Enclosed and then, simply nowhere. To an extent, within the music more powerfully, part of the light transitional. Movement. Undirected by self. Ebbing. "
"Saw - spirals, blobs, the dome, others, pictures in my mind's eye. 
Thought - that I shouldn’t have cancelled the 2 seats for tomorrow! About Robin + Ray + Johnny.
About food… lunch! And practicalities, Joel + sleep.
Friday + mum + Joel + Robin + Garden + Sleep + Dreamachine.
Felt - my tummy gurgle, my body relax, noticed how I kept my ‘......’ to thoughts + would sometimes notice my body more.
I love using the chalks on black at the end, the cobalt blue is delicious!"
"Body stilled. Very soft, shallow breathing. Steady heartbeat.
Green square. "
"The taster five minutes wasn’t particularly pleasant. I kept wanting my eyes to be more shut but they were fully shut. I liked the darker colours I saw, and felt most relaxed when it didn’t feel bright. I wished I had been able to smoke a grass-joint before we started! I’m not going to draw because I feel like I can’t remember many of the shapes. I thought I was seeing my own retina and was wondering if the squiggles were blood flow on the back of my eyelids. A woman snoring beside me made me laugh and I’m not sure I could fully let myself go, and be unaware I was in a shared space, but I’m glad I did it."
"This was amazing, I saw lots of colours, mostly green, red, purple, lilac, yellow, gold. I thought I saw a lion in yellow and gold, a space ship coming in to land, pulsating in purple, blue, white, an octopus’s tentacles in whites and blue."
"Burst of red and purple.
Kaleidoscope of colours red/green/orange turquoise in harlequin designs expanding opening, merging. Forming a tunnel, going in waves. Felt an expansion of mind total relaxation of body. Would do this every day if I could. "
"Very bright orange/red. Flooding - energising + uplifting - intense.
Stars, the galaxy. Lights + shadows refracting in a swimming pool. Zooming into space. 
Being inside a flower, eyes seeing like an insect. Didn’t feel relaxed - chest was tight - energy not fear. Feeling positively charged.
View from top of skyscraper, down speeding cars on a street far below. 
Finding a lonely spaceman, who needed to be rescued. He just appeared in mid-space.
Music was intense, loved it. "
A kaleidoscope of geometric shapes breaking down into smaller square shapes focused in the centre. Usually 2 colours orangy red and turquoise blue back and a violet purple predominantly black simple hieroglyphics seen in the orange boxes around the edges of the kaleidoscope. Faster and faster with the music. Feeling - calm. 
"Warmth
Relaxation
Floating
Withdrawal from reality.
Letting go."
It was the most relaxed I have felt in a very long time as I felt that I was able to truly ‘switch off’. It felt as though I was asleep yet awake + still aware of the light around me. I saw a lot of moving stars + felt like I was under the ocean too. I experienced a lot of blue + red movements. There was also purple moments. I can’t describe it.

More shapes, then me inside the castle looking in at myself. 
I felt free, spiritual and safe. When it finished I felt relaxed feeling."
"Felt like travelling through space - disco space. Very psychedelic - a trippy experience. At times felt very calm + relaxed. At times felt a little uneasy but only momentarily and felt safe the whole time.
A special experience. Thank you. "
"I saw lots of colours and shapes that moved in time with music.
I felt calm for most of it and relaxed. I thought the shapes looked like what you might find if you were to fly through the galaxy.
Loved it and love how it is free for all to experience! Thank you! "
"It was immersive to the point I felt I wasn’t even breathing. Here, I saw a line emerge with houses and people, with a line then cutting through it all."

I found the first part very intense visually and at times even a little overwhelming.
The second part was a lot more mellow and I felt much more relaxed during that. "
"It didn’t feel like eyes were closed, they were finally open. I lost track of my breathing in the brightest moments when I felt uneasy at the brightness. It was very enjoyable and so interesting to follow the shapes and colours. "

"Everything started very relaxing, there were some explosions of light in different colours, then some shots of energy appeared as thunders, forming some shapes that I recognised from my childhood."
"How can you possibly see with your eyes closed?
I saw chaos and disorder and it was beautiful. Then order tried to break through but it didn’t stand a chance. "

I found it hard to keep my eyes closed. The more intense the experience the more enjoyable it was. I found myself smiling a lot."
"I felt like I was in a living, pulsating, colourful pattern. It was overwhelming at times but I had to lean in and succumb to the experience. "
I felt so relaxed like I was floating. Often found myself swaying with the shapes. At one stage I saw a lion's face clear as day. Could see a disco ball with rays of light coming from it. Lots of glittering butterflies.

I felt like I was looking at a map for another dimension. 
I felt very relaxed and peaceful.
"Lots of colours. Many shapes flying past and coming back again. Moving very fast though something. Lots of layers, monochrome swirling in the background and many colours like kaleidoscope swirling in the foreground. "
"I was floating through different landscapes, warmed by the sun that kept coming out, hot and strong. I went through different weather, snow storms, sun, ice. Most of the colours were natural & blended into the landscape, but 2 colours kept appearing together that clashed and seemed unnatural. They came in blocks like cracked glass or cubes and seemed to form a deckchair like shape at the bottom of my field of vision. 

As I progressed to the end of the music I felt I left the earth and floated through the cosmos towards God who was light, indigo and deep purple. It  was comforting and exciting, as if I was coming home. As if all the chaos that went before fell away and everything was in order.

"
Endless geometric fractals, occasionally saw more recognisable shapes- moustaches came up a lot. Saw most of what i’d _____ the “visible spectrum”, mostly red and blue, but was surprised by a sort of poo brown-green, which I remember distinctly because it was an ugly shade. Spirals flickering. Started off as squarish, terracotta, the styles, got more curved. Was like two images layered - one flickering and one large, one moving gently further away, more detailed. 
"
"Many childhood memories came up for me. Deep belly laughter, sheer joy and freedom of running, dancing and playing in the grass. Buttercups were flashing up consistently. Big flashes or orange that fizzled out into a sheet of red and light pinks. I smiled a lot during this experience and felt mostly relaxed and at ease which where my thoughts wondered. I could hear the waves crashing loudly on the shore. I could hear laughter and playful tendencies - perhaps in the playground. I didn’t want the experience to end. The first time in a long time I felt free, and connected with my thoughts."
"A guided meditation. Into a half dream - like state of “imagined” visual and thought and then back to the flashy visual and light and then again. When the repetitive ____ began near the end, it felt/sounded like a descending helicopter signally a return. My eyes almost snapped open and yet I felt a deap set yearning for the experience not to end. Throughout, when the light ceased flashy/pulsating, I repeatedly returned to the blue. A blue central rectangular door entity blue light but with a matrix of almost white lines as a constant somewhere within. "
I felt as if I was floating through some kind of universe. Things were constantly moving i often felt as if I was being pulled forward towards something or falling away from something. Things were spinning as if the colour was a globe shape and I was moving through it into different sections or watching it from.
"Geometric patterns spiralling and flashing, trees colours red + blue, yellow + green, purple and black these flashed and moved to the pulse of the music. "
"Extremely relaxed, I enjoyed everything I saw - very vibrant colours and deep contrast. Experienced a feeling or enclosure and tunnel vision.

"Pretty open minded to the experience an on entering. Most of the time very relaxed occasionally it felt very intense and like the light was pressure down me - felt like extreme light + heat experienced a lot of blue and green + red like a kaleidoscope in my head.

I felt very at peace at times like when I was ___  and dragged out my bed at night to see the northern lights. It seemed to pass so quick- but I could have been there for hours. 
"
"
I saw lots of throbbing geometric shapes & grids, & basketweaves designs. It seemed to have very rigid forms & was unlike trippy swirly 60s patterns I thought I would see. It made me wonder why the forms I saw were so square & angular & in straight lines? Is that becuase my brain values orders and tidiness (I am a bit of a neat freak virgo)

I felt very safe & curious throughout it all but felt very restless in my legs towards the end. Thanks for the experience.

Deep relaxation which morphed into visions of travelling through space & unknown galaxies with vibrant planets and visionscapes. I also saw my daughter ( stunning blissful ) & looking directly at me on a beach. 
"I had a spiritual journey through time + space. It felt about the whole universe & light and dark. I felt emotional, I cired I felt connected to other humans. I felt intense & the shops & colours were intense. There was a kaleidoscope of colours. I felt like I had to go to the light & I had to accept the dark. I felt we are all infinite & unique. The shapes & patterns were intense. I had to connect back with breath & check I was alive + reality was still ok + had to open my eyes. I then moved into a purple + green forrest type space in the second part. "

"Panoptical vision flow of thought and suspension there of without ideas or form but shaping all things in the minds eye for consciousness is not real and nothing is forever but eternal in the void of forever

"I was floating through different landscapes, warmed by the sun that kept coming out, hot and strong. I went through different weather, snow storms, sun, ice. Most of the colours were natural & blended into the landscapes, but 2 colours kept appearing together that closed and seemed unnatural. They came in black like cracked glass or cubes and seemed to form a deckchair like shape at the bottom of my field of vision. 

As I progressed to the end of the music I felt I left the earth and floated through the cosmos towards God who was light, indigo and deep purple. It was comforting and exciting, as if I was coming home. As if all the chaos that went before fell away and everything was in order. 
"
"Lots of yellow at the calmer music at the start of the sessions - as ___ them with dark blue/pruple near the crescendo / end. Music often very danceable. Then shapes in ___ moving away from my self. A lot of hexagonal 3D shapes, infinite grey - also at one point little twinkling red stars and Saturn on the left. Also saw a lot of children looking up in a kind of pit but not scary - they were content and happy. Saw my parents as well especially when younger near the end of the experience (especially my mother) I saw all the colour = but probably not brown. Shapes moving a lot. ____ out the sides of the back. It was a pleasurable experience. l"
"Numbers for some strange reason 
Red + Blue
Then violet and green

"Joy euphoric happiness 
Release of happy memories
Loss of anxiety about death excitement

"An inverted sea scape of being 
It scooped up, me, my feelings, my textures and they began to blossom a bath of lite I backed in goodness bittersweet goodness
"
"
Feel like sinking into a constantly - changing, endless hole. No thoughts Just meditation & relax. 
"
"Lots of colours. Bright and dark lines, include red, blue, purple, green orange and yellow.

Each colour lines change every time and they become gorgeous pictures in your mind. 
"
"
The experience went by so fast i saw lots of geometry of all colours. 
Once I felt as though I wanted to shout in orange and yellow. Lots of loving feelings, family. 
Tingling in my hands and warmth in hands. 
"
"
The music at the start was annoying and made me anxious after the sounds started coming together it was more relaxing and at the end I was calmer. I had my eyes closed but was aware of the light and then the darkness as the light changed. 

I find it had to relax my brain never switches off but by the end my mind was quieter. I never saw any pictures or figures. 
"
"Weirdly felt less in my body and less emotional than with the deep listening experience. But far more visuals. Crazy visuals, bright colours like optical illusions, pop art & exotic tile. Some nice gradients of light too, sunlight & the colour of ripe fruit. Oranges & warmth. Super intense at times - shiftly patterns causing me to squint - even shed a tear.Lots of red, whites, steely blues + greys in the patterns + illusion kaleidoscopic  "
"I felt like I was floating above the clouds in a space of pulsating stars and explosions of colours. I felt this how it feels to die? But in the most peaceful blissful and calm state. I never wanted to leave this state. At one point I was floating through a star gate as in 2001 a space odyssey. In another I was driving down a blue tinged highway at night with a blue tinge. In another moment I was lying under a warming orange, brightly lit sun, pulsating rhythms giving me massive energy rushes which energised my brain and body. "
"I saw a lot of patterns based on pink and mustard yellow like an old marble effect book cover. At times I could see black and white checkerboard and felt like I was in a circus or waiter going round and round, faster and faster. When the light would suddenly shine brighter I felt like I had opened the curtains on a lovely sunny day. This is an immediate great feeling for me, very content. "
"
I was forced to smile, travelling at warp speed through space and then climbing the edge of a skyscraper as it tumbled backwards. When each phase ended I saw loads of green creatures that split into smaller forms in the darkness, then smaller & smaller until they disappeared. The spinning near the end came with more white and red that I had seen earlier. I saw a lot of stars & maple leads. I tried to control the direction I was moving in and had some success.I tried to control the colours I saw & had no success. I feel more connected to being a living being. 
"
"
Lots of shapes spinning in space, mostly red with some green and blue. When the light dimmed I could see dark blue lines + shapes against the darkness. It was very intense at times, I feel I was flying through space, really could feel the motion! I kept glimpsing a shiny surface like the outside of a spaceship, not sure if this was my eye being slightly open at time. I didn’t see anything that seemed to be in the ‘rear’ world apart from when the sound of a helicopter started and I saw motor blades and cos spinning, so the music could definitely influence the visuals. Some of the shapes turned into glowing orbs at times. 
"
At first I saw a very bright yellow / orange light then as the flashing begin the lights muted __ that bright light to red + blue geometric shapes dancing around one another. That went on for a short period of time then I fell asleep but still aware of the music I felt a deep sense of relaxation at it was over before I knew it. I felt very safe + very cosy. 
"A little nausea at first but then I sank into the experience - a surge of emotion - peace, wonder, love, floating excitement, exhalation when the patterns became really vivid. Definitely calm when the lights _____ and the swirling colour turned dark but not without pattern. The latter patterns looked like hot milk mixing with coffee while being poured!
A trip into space - a bit like ‘2001 a space odyssey’ the end journey. 
The music contributed to the excitement. 
"
"Amazing! Very profoundly lovely, astonishing that just lovely sounds and strobe lights can provide such an immersive experience. Especially loved the warm ‘sunny’ glow like phases - must have grinned a lot! Not unlike drug induced experiences in many _____ certainly similar physical sensation tho lacking the manipulability of these - my own hallucination/mind games being pretty much limited to patterns - But great! Wish it could have been twice as long. "
Going through a tunnel / feeling like falling in an elevator - whilst going through the tunnel / portal. I always seen a cross shape in the centre like the following example: 
"Patterns. Grids. Amazing selection of colours (from white light) especially when the pace increased toward the end. Pulsating, changing coming in and out. "
"A changing image always had a centre. If I moved my eyes, the centre moved with it. Patterns, like mosaics, animated and changed colours. Some colours were intense and quite saturated. Symmetry was evident. I tried to picture an image myself to see if I could impose a theme or a ___ image but there was no intrusion into the abstract, structural forms that offered limited pictorial, space ( the images were quite flat, no hint of perspective or overlap of shapes.)"
"I wanted to break out into a big universe and expand I wanted to see the angels of my dad. I had a feeling of expanding into something big. I miss my dad & feel sad he died this year. I wonder a lot about death & how I'd be and I expand into the light. The music was intense at one point and I felt I wasn’t sure where I was. It reminded me of being a passenger in a car with the sun dancing in and out of the trees or being the strobe light at a rave in the ___ we had a homemade dream machine in our house back then. It was the _________ 
I felt joyous in the lights but feel or sad now. 
"
"I thought about dying and how we didnt spend much time with ourselves anymore. Have our souls been moulded into 2 short attention span…
Will some ___be bored in the afterlife? Is that possible? I often imagine that death is this experience, an endless display of light and pattern. I was able to have a safe experience of contemplating death without dread. It was cathartic. 
"
"I felt a lot of chills growing stronger in my spine, scalp and legs with the beat of the music growing louder and louder and louder. I think that it called ASMR ( Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response?) 

It was deeply relaxing. I would use different colours to represent the different sounds and beats of the music but I didn’t really see any. It was more of a feeling  
"
"
I felt tearful in a good way, right from the start + throughout my experience, like I was tapping into feelings I’ve been carrying around unable to express. The colour sensation I saw were life and death - the embryonic beginning of life, a heartbeat, the loss of a loved one, festivals in the sun, images of vehicles of war (a ___, a helicopter), a fern uncurling toward the light.
"
"When the beat begins to rise, I feel like experiencing a sunrise. Full of orange yellow light.And I can see something shaking in the form of a new which includes green, pink, and dark purple in the gray background. I don’t know why but I am sure that the background is grey. And whenever the beat is going to stop. I feel the scene begins to turn blue and purple. "
"Not sure if I fell asleep initially, I tried breathing. Then I opened and closed my eyes at various times, then it was over. 
"
"While relaxing it very busy with (alternated breathing) kaleidoscope images, then some block colours let me catch my breathing and get it back into sink. I really felt I was watching a small screen."
I saw colours change with the flash intensity. Blue when slowly flashing and red when full beam. It was very peaceful and it was easy to focus on generic shapes. 
"Squares in a tunnel, turned into static bright yellow like looking at sun behind clouds. Then turned blue, looked like a light in deep water at night. "
"Being under water at certain points, seeing the surface but staying stationary looking up at it. Loads of swirling shapes, colours and patterns. Blues when the lights dimmed. Sometimes really intense blue, almost greenish blue. Often circular focal point while the colours and patterns swirled. "
"I felt like I was sleeping (maybe I did fall asleep) I kept seeing a book nothing on the cover just plain but hard back book with lots of pages.

Lots of colours, shapes flowers, spinning shapes that made me feel dizzy at points. I felt like the light was so bright at times that I needed to close my eyes then I remembered they were.

I felt cold toward the end too. 
"
"

At first I felt in primordial waters, then in the womb and the light of birth in seeing this world. At some point being on a bees panel. The rest of the time it was empty (blackness) and few thoughts. 
"
"
I felt anxious. And overwhelmed. I saw geometric shapes and flashes of colour. I saw warm yellow light, which felt calming. The lights patterns, frequency and colours changed every few second. 
"
"At first I began to imagine I was on a desert planet, then in a dark blue underground night club. Then the vividness of the colours took out of the need to embellish it with ideas and I let go into the psychedelic visualisations. 
At one moment my eyes twitched with the bombardment of colours but I relaxed and it felt like I entered into the inside of a big red ball. 
"
Feeling of interconnectedness. The closest ive felt to understanding the concept of infinity.  
"Colours of light, white, orange, red and blue. Spinning left and right and coming and going. A sensation in the temples of my head. Also in the back of my neck. "
"Relaxing
Expansive tessellated shapes from a central focus.
On occasion softer expansive shapes (circular ripples)
No clearly identifiable objects.
No reliable perception of the passage of time - it was longer than my internal clock suggested 
"
"Lots of different colours and shapes, shapes and colours spiralled and transformed into different forms. Sometimes I saw one bold colour - yellow and orange. I saw palm trees. "
Warm and womb-like - afloat - eventually like falling into an expansive psychedelic nebula. 
"Extremely stimulating.
Would recommend
More of this would be AMAZING.
Thanks to the team!"
"A journey through life, the universe and beyond.
Made me feel very happy, relaxed and comfortable.
It is what I would imagine to a beautiful end. "
"Like I was seeing the start and end of the universe… but it’s a calm/trippy way and style.
Also got a lot of thinking done re my work life. Lots of things planned. Basically it created space for me to think. "
"I tried to keep the blindfold off, but it was overwhelming. So I also put the blanket over my head. Then I felt calm. I then saw my childhood bedroom and felt happy and secure in the pitch black. "
I felt like I was underwater at first with the sun shining through and then I felt like I was lying in the sand or on the grass with the sun shining on my face. I felt safe and warm and surrounded by something comforting. I wish I could live in that world. I still got sucked into my thoughts and had to bring myself back to the room and the music and lights helped. I loved all the colours and shapes and it made me feel peaceful and happy.
"The changes from very bright to dark made me feel like I was falling.
I was not aware of time.
At times it felt like I was moving through or into the light. "
"I felt an instant sense of calm (almost euphoric).
I seen the most incredible mandala designs flowing past my tunnel vision.
I saw people rowed in front of me (outlines) roughly six rotating around me, too fast to focus on but visible enough to see.
I saw a small outline waving from the inside of a matrix."
"Felt relaxed, focused, happy, unaware of surroundings.
Disappointed when it ended - could happily have stayed longer. 
Patterns started fast and difficult to see but slowed down as the music got louder.
Very aware of bells, chimes ringing throughout - felt focused.
Not aware of ant heat/cold or taste - very focused on auditory."
"Darkness, bright lights,
Orange colours, lines,
Blue lights, depth,
Calmness, serenity,
Widen of vision,
Orange, sand,
Pyramids, sky,
Darkness. "
"I saw eyes, electricity, and kaleidoscopic visuals. Morphing and blending and coming and going. Sometimes it was difficult to know if my eyes were open or shut. The colours of the lights in the room seemed to bring upon my changing visual experience. It was like relaxing psychedelic drugs. "
"I saw a red sky. Like after a forest fire.
Green lightning.
An arctic wilderness
A waterfall
A bird of prey (falcon?)
Doves towards the end"
"I felt warm but couldn’t quite settle and I felt itchy in different places on my body throughout the experience. I felt safe, but not quite comfortable for some reason + couldn’t fully relax."
"I found this ethereal, nostalgic and reminiscent of childhood. It made me smile deeply about family and memories.
It was a relaxing, peaceful experience. "
It was a very calming and gradual experience. I’m still ‘.....’ it now. It felt very short - I am curious as to how long it was. The music brought us back to previous psychedelic experiences - I had a sense of being brought into the “deep space”.
"Vortexes and vortices, membrane + spiralling grids.
Like visualised string theory."
"Invaded
Like electric shocks
Claustrophobic "
"Very vivid colours red mainly orange turning to greens and very tranquil blues -
Hands, noses (?) and very unified cracked glass -
The AHA video springs to mind -
Pencil drawn people and faces
3d almost because of multiple layers of spinning patterns.
Hands holding fluorescent (?) light bulbs lit up. "
There was a bright light at the beginning then I saw shapes mainly red squares in a pattern and a grey hole in the middle the whole time. The squares reminded me of a kaleidoscope. I saw yellow in the corners for most of the experience and the yellow would intensify at times then I would see another kaleidoscope type pattern. Blue was in the background during most of it. 
"Sense of calm
Wonderful colours
Shapes
Sounds… "
"Overwhelming
All-consuming
Ethereal
Sometimes euphoric
I saw lots of eyes
Zooming through space, down a corridor tunnel.
Geometric shapes swirling around. "
"Single colour saffron, varying in intensity was beautiful and calming and very bright, varying in shade intensity, almost heading towards “the Divine”, bright, very safe, pure warm. I saw this frequently and between whole and pattern sequences. Almost like a transition world. Some of the flashing patterns coupled with the “aggressiveness” of the music at times I found almost “jarring”, even though the colours were very vivid and the colour combinations plentiful and beautiful.
I wondered at times was this experience almost “out of body”. It wasn’t scary but it was a journey into an unknown place.
I found the single colours very calming which replicates my colour preferences in life. I prefer single colours to complex patterns. Thank you."
Very immersive with a beautiful array of colours. I found the music made it more intense. I settled in very quickly to the experience and would have been happy to continue the experience for longer. Thanks for a beautiful adventure into a world of fantastic colours - all of which added to a garden of Eden of my experience.
"As the room went dark at the beginning my tummy felt heavy. Then there were lovely shades of red that went into orange, then green and yellow flowing lines and a yellow eye with a green pupil. Then lots of square shapes coming together. It was amazing, I loved every bit of it, I would have liked it to continue on. I saw shadows of people also, moving I thought I may have gone into a dream, but I couldn’t see faces. Thank you so much for this amazing experience. "
"Wonderful geometric shapes, like x-ray crystallography, argyle knitting(!). Snowfall, flying yellow and blue crosses blending through each ‘......’. Building up and up. - Don’t follow the light at the end!
I found it hard to draw what was essentially a kinetic experience. "
"I saw a variety of colours in different rhythms of movement and shapes. I find that I can’t remember the images that i saw, not enough to be able to draw. Most of the time the ‘background’ colour was white with other colours and lines in front of it. There were times when the background colour was black, and it had small semi-circular pattern in a midnight blue, that was my favourite, most comforting pattern. I felt a variety of emotions, anxious and a lot of confusion as to how I ‘should’ be experiencing this. There were also moments of awe and wonderment at the human brain. I also felt the image in front of me would change depending on the intensity with which I closed my eyes. At times, I tried to experiment and see if I could willfully make myself see a particular colour. I have no recollection of this working. Thank you for an enlightening experience! "
"Initially I felt very relaxed , as though I was in a beautiful space filled with mountains, rivers, colourful flowers. I was sitting on the swing and enjoyed looking at nature. I think this was my imagination which was still in my control. After sometime I felt I should stop/control my brain/visions and let it flow naturally. I just saw some colours, they were very dark, and all I could see/feel was the same routine which I go through everyday, like on a train journey with my family members. All I could see was my daughters, husband’s face and I was interacting with them. I don’t remember clearly after this. I just woke up when I felt there was a bright light. I loved this experience, I think it helped me calm down. "
"Relaxing, mostly pleasant except for the build up of the sub bass frequencies; felt overwhelming. This was the only time I put my mask on and was able to see the impact on having this safety measure. After I was used to hearing the new levels with subsonic frequencies, I took the mask off and was able to continue enjoying the shapes and patterns shown in my mind/eyelids? It was like a kaleidoscope. At times, my attention was drawn to the music and had an experience where the bells could represent the little stars that were blinking but mostly was focused at the visual representations and allowing myself to let go. I noticed that when I was thinking or analysing, the experience became overwhelming. After a few breaths, I was able to relax and be in the moment. A wonderful experience. Thank you! "
"As the lights came up, I started to see something like hieroglyphs but they were moving in time with the lights and music. It wasn’t super defined at first and there was something like crackles that you see at the end of old movies from the 1920’s. When the light speeds increased I started to see something like spinning vortices. There was washes of colour every time the light speeds changed. All kinds of colours. Some of them I’m not actually sure I’ve seen before. There were periods when it seemed like it was the day dawning into a bright sunny morning. It made me feel totally contented and happy. Most of all I remember thinking that the music sounded so perfect, I was actually nearly laughing at how good it sounded. I felt like at first I was viewing the images in front of my mind's eye but after a while it seemed like I was almost in the patterns. Really enjoyed the part when the music started to do the aural version of strobing and it changed the patterns I was seeing."
"I felt very calm and able to reflect on recent stresses and pressures in a neutral space. 
I was able to imagine waves of seaside ocean building up and crashing down. The ebb and flow of being somewhere otherworldly and peaceful. The ocean current was relaxing and soothing in sensation.
Like it all seems insurmountable and that it all will come crashing down but ultimately that is not always a bad thing, and should be expected. Ineffable. "
"It took a few minutes to slip into a sort of trance. It felt like I sunk in the seat and a very mellow kaleidoscope sort of visuals that changed with the music and the light colours. It felt like a mixture between a space-like area and deep sea area. I noticed after I got used to breathing slowly that I became more comfortable, which allowed the visuals that I experienced, to become more clear."
"Felt like travel into space. A feeling of mindfulness. Feeling of being light. Free from shackles and struggles of life feeling of new beginnings. Felt like I will be meeting favourite people of mine who are not alive. Felt like a burst of positivity and energy. Felt ecstatic and euphoric too. Towards the latter half. Thought of taking off in an aircraft or vehicle into space. Felt like in a garden with happy scenes of young playful kids. Pets, gentle warm happy people. Around, with butterflies, flowers. Felt very relaxed, de-stressed and sense of mindfulness. Sense of jumping up and down in joy. Very versatile and free. "
"A novel of illumination.
Showing possibilities and restriction.
The never ending experience of the want to see more occupying the gratitude of my own body. 
The bright light at the start, brought back embodied memories of the waves of light that greet me. It reminds me of the shared want of humans to experience the possibilities beyond our sensations. I want to inhabit the light, the dark, the wants and expectations and the love of the experience. "
"At first, was aim for relaxation. During blue light I had a feeling of stress which subsided once light moved on. Muscles relaxed and mind wondered.
During the middle phase, it felt like humanity going through the course of time on planet earth. Then the feeling of being scared as the sound changed to circular dark sounds, symbolising the end, whether the end of the human race or planet.
Then to experience the rebirth of life, as the planet goes on and moves forward to equilibrium and peacefulness, feeling at one and at peace. "
"Lots of bright flashing lights, quickly changing. I felt very relaxed, the experience felt like it lasted for only a few minutes. It felt like a deep meditation. I wasn’t thinking about anything in particular, just firstly focusing on my breath, then focusing on the lights/imagery I could see. I didn’t think I would experience this with just sound. "
"I felt happiness in a sense of light and colours, that made me smile and feel content when I saw + heard it.
It was a similar experience as to when I have taken mushrooms and acid. Feelings of content and calmness that is sometimes hard to feel in day to day life. "
"I have done a mindfulness course with voice only + breathing awareness. The pulsing sounds distracted me initially. I was part drifting but part aware of thudding in my head. Contrasts between wellbeing and strange plants unfolding sometimes just opening but sometimes like triffids - weird but wondering, like in a dream, seeing but not necessarily registering anything else. I liked the quieter tones, restful - heavier bass tones and darkening internal vision, was like something ominous passing overhead.
Very unusual, unique experience with coloured dots like tiny lights appearing now + then. Sometimes spacey, sometimes like being underwater. Also reminders of “Stranger Things” Netflix!! "
"At first I felt like I was about to be abducted by aliens and I was in a waiting room - waiting for the aliens to conduct experiments - then I spotted a bunny and followed him through a field until he turned into a bird/watched him fly though the sky and dive deep into the ocean until he became a fish. I watched as he explored the depths of the ocean…

When it went black I noticed the power of darkness but also the feelings the dark colour red instil in my body.. "
"Bright colours of green, yellow and purple separately. Each one in turn came close to me yet faded slowly back away. Felt very relaxed - arms hands legs + feet felt very heavy (paralysed like) but so comfortable.
Colours surrounded me in peace + harmony music - consoled me. "
"Sunrise over a still lake, images of textures found in patterns of nature like water ripples, animal prints like snake skin and then in more intense moments like an intense tunnel of flashing colours rapidly changing. At times I felt I would be overwhelmed but sticking with it gave me mental strength. I learnt to control some of the patterns with my gaze. "
"At times deep joy + relaxation, at other times I was almost overwhelmed/fearful. Some of the images that appeared - a starburst - like flowers/iris, birds. Forests, kaleidoscopic shapes, flashing lines, sunshine, flowing water, waves. One of the most unique experiences I’ve ever had. It felt very short - I have no idea how long it actually lasted. Amazing!"
"On a ride - excited + ‘.......’
‘.......’ - was of my hands
Reflective + relaxed
‘.......’ + connected"
"During strong light vivid kaleidoscopes of blues lines with warm yellows. Scared at ‘.............’
Red dots or hearts at the intensifying ‘.......’. As lights less intense pink ‘....’ and purple lines flickering across horizontally in both directions. "
"Sunshine, light, colour, patterns.
Uplifted, memory flashback, happy, building of mountain images.
Patterns colourful + totally uplifting. Relaxing experiences: quite emotional.
For me too:
Brought me to places I’d forgotten.
Joy and light.
Unaware of reality + totally joyous experience. "
"Just like moving geometric shapes, changing colours and speeds etc. "
"Relaxed peaceful contemplative 
Swirls of blue + light green merging and forming patterns and then going but being replaced by more.
A very nice experience. "
"Peaceful. 
Calm.
Warm.
At ease.
Easy to sleep.
Relaxed. "
Intense feelings of calmness + tranquillity. Feeling of being connected with my inner self. Eviscerating of all dark thoughts. 
"Fractals, patterns, colours, movement, the sun. Heat and space."
"Lots of colours all moving really fast
Felt relaxed but alert at the same time
I think i might have dozed off a bit "
"The birth of creation, lava, oceans, endless vortexes, decaying octopuses, the sun consuming us all, time and space collapsing, an endless presence in the centre, a pair of eyes looming in and out, ending with being thrown into the ocean and the plant life consuming us as the light evaporates.  "
"I travelled through space, to strange and distant planets. "
"Geometric spirals, swirling galaxies and swirling shapes, colours. As if tiny particles moving through a body or space, weightless, calming, fun. "
"Star and fireworks spinning at first.
Followed by shadowy outlines of figures, moving inwards and outwards.
Nebula-like, inter-galactic images at one point and these morphed out having different animal faces in the centre of them, like cats and frogs, which was funny. 
Purple and orange were the strongest colours I saw. "
"Saw lots of colours, shapes + objects. Didn’t think or feel a whole lot. Just went and let my mind go where it wanted.
Cool experience! "
"Feel: relaxed - calm.
See: lots of flashing dots - yellow, red, white light in the middle - yellow + red coming from it.
Heart ‘......’ shape at the bottom with red light underneath.
Think: How is this happening?!"
"The experience was very unique and interesting. My experience was very calming and relaxing.
Felt like being inside my own mind, exploring through all things that my mind can come up with. "
"Red - really blood red - turning to magenta.
Vector, mainly towards something."
Powerful
"A multitude of colours in various patterns and sequences.
It felt like I could see sound. 
I saw myself + my wife holding another baby in hospital. "
"Warmth of the sun. summer days.
Deep sleep and aware of everything.
Relaxation….peace and happiness. "
"It felt like a kaleidoscope of colours and shapes and a sense of both calm (when the light wasn’t flashing), and a sense of chaos when it was flashing, but like a good calming chaos.
When it went dark, I could see a deep blue/navy that felt very calming and grounding."
"It was different for different segments of the experience. For parts of it there were tesselated hexagons, pulsing with light in a beehive type pattern.
For other segments it felt like I was travelling through a wormhole in space with stars in a spiral galaxy type formation whirling around me. The wormhole was travelling through space-time. "
"A lot of fractal visuals
One in particular:
A fiery centre with a sanskrit style writing in green with a red outline. Orange peripheral fractals with cliff faces like canyon inside.
Another I saw a huge forest spinning around.
When it went dark it was blue webs not in motion."
I felt like I had shrunk to a tiny size and was flying through the blood vessels of a human being.
"Firstly I felt mother love, how I miss her and homeland. 
It was warm feel.
Then I started image flower and arabic desert with magic."
"Colour, colour, colour. More colour than I thought my brain knew about."
"Lots of shapes and colours, felt like sunrise
Sparkly water
Weightless

Seen scary faces and monsters in the dark and felt a presence almost touch me like sleep paralysis."
"Outstanding
So much of what I saw was a reflection of colours, shapes and a black + white movie of my sister from 1966 when I was 4 years old."
The colours were intense and had depth to them. I had to resist the urge to laugh through a sense of both joy and nerves (slight disbelieving at what was happening).
An experience which is purely meditational. Dipping in and out of sleep guided entirely by the music. Dreams of people in my life and fantastical landscapes appearing and disappearing infinitely. Relaxing and beautiful.
I really enjoyed the dreamachine had a really relaxing time and stress free. Thanks. 
"Was like a more muted version of the full sensory experience.
But dreamy + peaceful + gentle."
"I am trying to remember what I saw, but so much shit happened.
Saw some blue and green but mostly white. Lots of shapes too. And patterns. "
"Red and blue spinning fractals.
Like I was in the intro to a sci-fi space movie. "
"Lots of doors + windows + ladders.
Lots of patterns.
A few black ominous human like shapes.
Patterns swirling to left and right. "
"Harmony
Peace
Love
Geometry
Warmth "
"Joy
Peace
Fear
Divinity
Live, laugh, love"
"Amazing! 
Feel so relaxed after it!
Otherworldly. "
"Geometric patterns
Two centres at times
Patterns expanding and contracting
Predominantly whites and yellows, patterns in black
Drifting between awake and sleep."
Hard to put in words as I have never experienced that before. I went on an adventure with many lights.
"Calming feeling of blue, like swimming underwater; warm orange with brownish purple felt soothing; the lots of grey/white — red & blue - lke seedlings. At times, as if I was looking through a rain blurred windscreen. Association of propeller motion with the music. Felt as if the colours & lights were wrapped around. "
"I recall initial thick paint pot lids in viscous and distinct single colours, the visuals then moved on to the palate of jeff koons and 3D shapes started to take hold a period of supercuts that tpassed at too quick a slip to summon then back to single lights and specific memories, past walks, intimate encounters, there was time to dwell and reflect here, back on to the hectic 2001 space odyssey, gasper noe credits, teenage dancefloors and the touchdown finding myself fully in a large space, the colour was purple which I’m not naturally inclined, but as purple goes this was the best I’d known was properly impressed and my third eye thank you

"
"It was mad. The most vivid and dynamic kaleidoscope ever. It was intense and ____. I wanted to open my eyes and shut them tight. I ws restful and alert. It was a strange and familiar experience at the same time sometimes it felt like I was hyper aware, then at times I felt in a time fod. The colours were bright and sharp, smooth and full. The main colours I saw were red and blue, then when it went dark, this neon green  lines emptied. There were oranges and greys and mushroom browns. Royal purple (RIP queen lol) and the shapes were _____. Sometimes it was really geometric, sometimes softer, but always moving and shifting into each other. "
"Over time I started to feel really awake surprised by the realisation that my eyes were still closed. Thoughts of daily life slowly disappeared one time, getting les and less, and particularly when the light and sound became more intense or intensify 

The feeling was most ____________ in and out of the darkness, energy into light and of __________.  There was a sense of calm and the ridiculousness of life _________
I looked forward and as I did clouds of darkness and light would gather and  fade at the centre slowly disappearing as a new gathering of light emerged. I was fully at ease and had some light _____ beautiful, calm, relaxing, experience.

At one point I saw something like a flower, I think a symbol I have sen during reiki sessions before . I think a symbol used for a chakra but not sure. 
"
"
See - different colours - often blue/green/teal/ + red/orange/pink 
Often undulating, sometimes pulsing, reminded me of a jellyfish moving in ester
On another occasion green almost grass at bottom of vision = blue above this

Feel - at times felt warm + as if my body was light like I couldn’t feel my legs + feet at other times felt heavy as if my body was pinned to chair + I couldn’t move ( I could move when I tried) felt very relaxed. 

Think - sometimes I thought about moment from my childhood, happy moments with family. Often moments I had been outdoors in sunlight with them. Grand parents beach etc.  
"
"I saw a kaleidoscope of colours and shapes. Mostly red and white diamonds and fractals. Sometimes the colour background was blue or green with grey shards and lightning bolts in the foreground. A golden yellow light was a main ___ for me.

I thought of happy experiences and people who make me happy. The noise in the beginning reminded me of a beeping heart monitor which made me feel uncomfortable. The sounds towards the end reminded me of a helicopter and also made me feel uncomfortable. 
Overall it was a calming experience, although I found it hard to keep my eyes shut. 
"
"The light was initially blinding. The physical reaction to intensely shut them to protect them soon shifted to exquisit colours rapidly moving in all directions. I felt like I was a character in a game running, jumping, flying, gliding … free! Taking in each change from bizarre ____ of Tokyo style billboard to floating over landscapes up into the atmosphere among the stars. The longer the experience went on the more absorbed I became, losing myself utterly from the world as we know it into this wonderful exciting and powerfully peaceful realm. It game were a brief space to enjoy a quiet mind, that is always a buzz. A form of meditation I would gladly adopt daily. Thank you for this wonderful experience."
"At times solid colour - reds or yellows and a general sense of pressive at the front of my head - slowly rotating haze other moments with flashing colours - starting with primary colours reds, blue, yellow, and later on bright vivid pinks, white with faded orange and green. The intensity of colour felt overwhelming and scary until I relaxed into it. With the changing kaleidoscopic patterns were moving geometric shapes in the background - a lot of movement - rotating and oscillating and sometimes a tunnel motion with forward + backwards motion At these times the pressure felt more at the back of my head. I felt a sense of drifting and immersion and I felt further away from my body. "
"Firstly, I experienced brightness in a way I had never before. ____ Brightness which filled me with joy. And from there, a journey of piece (?) More than “see” it was a “feel”. It felt pure and clean, relaxing and intense at the same time. I wasn’t here, but I wasn’t there either. I was actually knowhere, receiving a message. I can’t actually comprehend. It felt like different species trying to communicate with us.  "
"Colours, shapes, water, fire
Rainbows, warmth, cold
I was melting in the chair
Repeating shapes motion & lot of motion
My senses were intense 
When it was going dark the shapes were keep repeating themselves 
Triangles, circles, waves, flashing weird patterns with blue I was feeling cold, changing shapes, with red, hot feeling / the ___ from other shapes. I was feeling going around the room.
My eyes were crying. I wanted to open them but I also didn’t. I felt goosebumps. Stars also. I felt calm, but also aware of everything. Felt relaxed but also in control of myself felt weird nicely weird. 
"
I saw bright sunlight and felt the warmth of the air. It was broken by continuing waves of patterns and colours spinning around my body. There was some movement as I flew forward and descended down below the landscape. All the visions were abstract and unlike anything I expected to see and a complete contrast to my everyday experience. 
"I saw a series of interlocking gears turning on and on. Midway through, there were series of triangles opening in onto and around each other as colours and diamonds appeared in the periphery. In the centre of triangle was a burst of colour which hovered and pulsated on on eve and in sync with the thumps of bass this is what I drew afterwards, I saw gears turning and rotating until it finished. "
"Mainly red + blue chequers with purple + green waves when the light changed to black. There were others but I struggle to remember -  fading like a dream. At first I found it difficult to keep my eyes closed with my lids flickering viscously, I also felt motion and slight nausea which passed quickly - at points I thought I was sleeping. Extremely floating + relaxed. "
"Short lived ever changing pulsating colourscape - predominantly red. Jagged edges, circles. 
Relaxing, peaceful, warm, engaging able to think in colour. Repeating patterns kaleidoscope. Very dream like hard to remember, leaving my head quickly.
Very enjoyable, similar to previous drug experiences.
"
"
Changing visuals with the ‘beat’ of the sounds a heavy red and black flashing spike +++ the other prodominant colours were purples + blues on a ‘black’ background which was _____. Found it hard to shut mind off and focus on what I was seeing even though I wanted to, hard to shut a busy mind off. I enjoyed the shift from forced visuals + seemingly? all over visuals like a kylidoscope (spelling?) 
"
"
I saw and felt waves in the beginning when it was slower and darker, it seemed as if the waves emanated from one shape in the centre of my vision, which looked as if I was always moving. When the lights moved faster each time I always saw little stars or speckles which often gave way to a kaleidoscope of pink and blue. I saw this many times and found it quite intense at first because it demanded to be seen. The whole experience reminded me of a memory I had from when I was a child - I was sat in a classroom pressing my hands into my closed eyes to search deeper into the colours and shapes that were appearing and moving and shifting. It felt exactly like that, like I was discovering part of the universe, transcending beyond myself. 
"
"A very enjoyable experience but maybe not quite as intense or all-consuming as I was gearing myself up for. I saw lots of complex geometric patterns in lots of colours but maybe not much more than that. It didn’t really result in any change in feeling, other than relaxation. I wouldn’t have classified it as in any way transcendental and it didn’t really bring me any insight into my own consciousness. For me, the results I have experienced from the use of psychedelic drugs have perhaps been more profound and intense. I will admit that the experience was still quite remarkable considering no such substances were involved"
I felt uncertain how much time had past. I wasn't always sure if I was awake. I felt very calm - almost as if I wasnt breathing. I saw a lot of geometric shapes and sometimes a very intense yellow like burning sun between music segments I sometimes saw purple with pink lines of very deep strong blue. Sometimes it felt like someone was opening and closing a number of screen tabs - something would pop ip and then close down again. Geometric shapes in a kaleidoscope. Usually black + white but sometimes in pink + purple. 
"
I saw lots of bright colours, a frenzy of shapes that stopped and started, increased in intensity and speed, and craziness. 
And I thought thank goodness my dreams are not like this! I felt it was very mechanical, lots of clashing sensations, and the only relief was when it stopped, and it was then all calm. That was then lovely. Very mechanical in that I though of machines and space and ____ images. At the beginning I sort of felt I was seeing it through my eyes, but then it gradually went deeper and deeper into my brain, which was rather a wonderful sensation. A deep calmness. I felt very little emotion though, a sort of nothingness - rather nice actually. 
"
"Was a very intense experience. Felt like I was on a journey through various locations inside my own head. When the lights would go back to bright white it felt like a reset before you were taken to the next spot. Really opened my mind to how powerful the brain and imagination is. 
"
A huge light is sparkling into my eyes.I felt my eyes are something like dancing? Or pumped into a great amount of sunshine at the beginning. When both of my eyes are adapted to the light. I can saw the unique shape changing dramatically according to the light changing. 
"Felt very intense first taster session - felt slightly panicky - anxious. Then breathing helped - slowed down - began _____ and look forward to next part. Fascination graphics produced by my own brain. Beautiful colours, shapes, movement. Enjoyed the noisier bit and Jon Hopkins music. Was disappointed when it finished. Calming, sunrise part enjoyable too. Glad I did it. "
"
It was a very intense experience. The flashing lights came in all colours and a mix of organic patterns and geometric shapes. I found the fast strobe too much and used the eye mask to black out some of the light. After the experience I feel a bit like I am travel sick. 
"
"
I saw lots of colours but mostly in neon - neon purple, neon pink & purple, felt as if I was going down holes in the galaxy at high speed then as if I was orbiting dark matter on neon rings. I also thought about a friend of mine who passed away recently & how I should reach out to him 
"
"I saw a change of colours, mainly red/orange/yellow, back and green. I saw what could be perceived as an embryo. I saw a woman made out of red and black petals. Mid section.. I saw what I perceived as a wormhole. With a change in music I saw my colours break from chaotic gases/nebulas into cascading dots. "
"Geometric patterns - like concentric circles and waves - pulsing, __-__ in time with music. I would see a cloudy sky, like if I was lying down and looking up at the sky. Light blue background with white clouds. When the lights would go off & pitch black and very subtle vertical blue/violet lines like a curtain. "
"Vivid colour, and movement - pattern changing felt I was travelling it was also relaxing."
"Very relaxing, often with soft gentle patterns. At times very cleary defined shapes, though of no regular shape of shape from nature. "
"Bombardment of colour. Powerful on the eyes. Tired after the experience. 
Resisting at time on flashy of lights. Felt safer then I thought - ___ fear of the experience. 
"

"Changing shapes and colours, looking like a magic eye book. Fizzing and morphing. Some moments were calming & meditative others were a little frightening when the music became intense (sounding like a helicopter blades behind my head). I felt like someone was watching me from behind sometimes like a finger tapping me in the middle of my back. 

Mostly it was abstract shapes but once I saw a grid with a sphere in the centre with a shape that looked like a planet & I saw a woman several times but I couldn’t make out her face. She glowed white in a silhouette repeated like one of those magic lantern images. Flashing along the bottom of my vision. At first I thought I was seeing someone sitting opposite through my lashes but I checked and I wasn't peaking! 
"
"Most of the time I was a viewer of the most incredible geometric kaleidoscopic light show, but for a time towards the end of the experience. I felt that I was standing in the entrance of another dimensions. "
"Thank you 
I would like one of these at home
This is my second time time 
Same:
Sequences of colours 
E.g. black, yellow, white, blue + orange the into dark green with magneta + mustard
Same “helicopter” moment same patterns. E.g. mirror balls disco lights, cracked glazed
Different:
More overall
More peripherally 
Longer
More layered/3D
More similes or comparisons or “real” events 
E.g. seeing snow flakes then being in a snow globe
E.g. cracked light that was like an eye test + then I was in a lizard eye 
E.g being in an ___ picture moving.  
"
"I saw a warm - peaching colour that I didn’t like that much. It was arranged in pentagon-like shapes that rotated, warped and moved about my vision. In the background were hazy bubbles and as the intensity died down it appeared as if I was under water. I also got a tunnel visual that felt as if I was travelling towards. Physically I noticed my body move, my gums and teeth were so apparent for some reason. I struggled to keep my eyes shut. I remember enjoying the soundtrack a lot and definitely felt a sense of time-dilation, time pressed quicker than it ____ was. I enjoyed it overall and was comfortable, wish it could have lasted a bit longer. "
"
My experience was incredibly calming. I only saw light, soft colours. Lots of ____ patterns and a few “matrix” like grid as my eyes readjusted when the strobes stopped. I am amazed to see how much the experience differed. Where I felt yellow and green, shapes, other saw red + blue aggressive shapes. This is magic. Thank you !
"
"I hate to say but lots of comets hitting things, and mushroom clouds. 
Like the explosion in “AKRIA”
Cool though 
"
"This was an unusual relacing experience feeling. The warmth of the colours, unusual in that even with eyes closed, light gets in. The light without shapes was the most relaxing."
Peaceful chilled experience very relaxing takes you away from all outside noises relaxes you could help with people with stresses and anxiety to relax

I saw a nice curly hallway, some flesh next to some insects/butterfly wings

"I feel I am in a forrest 
I was born from a rok 
I have no connection with this world
"
"Transcendental kaleidoscope of colours and geometries through liminal flashes of intensity followed by calm, still, peace and serenity.

The intensity spiralled from the centre outwards, like a chaotic ball of energy being dissipated in rhythm to the sound. Total detachment of body & mind.
"
"
I saw the journey from what I feel it will be to die. I saw 360 vision of being inside an atom and outside an atom all at the same time it was really like the experience had with DMT and ketamine I feel very calm and peaceful and all is and all is as it should be.
"
"
A sense of cleansing and rebirth. I felt my mind cleaning and my soul becoming closer to original source. A sense of renewed purpose. Memories (emotional) of the interlife. A feeling of travelling through the multiverse. A feeling of connection and self worth, of being a part of something greater than this human experience. A feeling of peace, calm gratitude and deeper awakening. 
"
"I was very aware of a sense of travel specifically moving quickly through a narrow caged roller coaster that only seemed to go downward.

"
Enjoyed the music especially when got louder and was aware of my whole body feeling relaxed could see different shapes and patterns. When my mind drifted off to work/home the change in music and light brought me back again.

A strange experience - a bit apprehensive during the taster but then relaxed into it found myself drifting off & then coming back to awareness of light & dark - some figures joined & then left 
"So many flames
And corridors
And moments of ‘......’ letting go
Like a ‘......’ to drop.
There were times when I enjoyed it so much that I laughed with the release of burden. Also I enjoyed the happy pretty lights."
Lots of colours. Rings that were turning fast in various directions with spikes coming out of them.
Lots and lots of different patterns and lots of different colours.
"It felt very strange to have such an immediate experience, could feel my brain readjusting to find some sort of depth of field.

As a result, I felt I could see far beyond myself, like the visuals had a great level of depth, expanded way beyond the end of the room. "
"It was quite an interesting experience with the audio and the light effects, an experience having so many random visuals accompanied with the sound seeming to drive the visuals along. So many interesting things to be seen with just the aid of sound and light and mind."
"It felt “dreamy”. A different experience to any other.
This is what dreaaaaams are made of!"
"Flashing lights, different colours, dots, stars. Felt safe and in control. Appreciation for what my eyes can do. I could see the vibrations. Felt like a deep meditation. "
It got me to see my memories.
"Saw a lot of patterns moving towards me, as well as to the left at the same time. Started with orange with faint white squiggles to a pitch black with hints of electric blue before patterns began."
"Lots of moving shapes, always something in the middle with lots of lines in the back behind it.
Thoughts were of how if I was to describe a vision to someone this how I’d describe it. "
"Multiple shifting patterns
Kaleidoscope style.
Central recurring Egyptian eye.
White crosses.
Vibrant purple + Blue
A lot of red and blue patterns.
Pulsing patterns
Travelling towards a central point a constantly deepening tunnel."
"Chilled out, relaxed, present, aware of sounds around me, time went very fast"
I felt the heartbeat and dark and light appear. The rhythm of the music.
"Relaxed, in touch with myself, really enjoyed the lights. Made to feel at ease."
Otherworldly 
"Calming. Feeling content
Like being inside a kaleidoscope
Empowering.
Shut out the rest of the world."
"In a deep state, seeing moving different shapes and feeling many different emotions. Relaxed and tense at the same time. Feeling lost in another dimension and feeling in control of your mind at the same time. "
"I have seen and experienced white light. Then different structures with a different colour. Some of them blurred but some of them bright enough.
The music resembles the structures forming in and fading out.
It was all in all a beautiful time spent in."
"Floating into space, seeing lots of beautiful colours. Reminded me of a huge vortex of colours. I was so relaxed and at peace. "
I felt like I was looking into a swimming pool of yellow and orange water. I could see the water and shadows change with the light as if it was reflecting. 
"Deep listening experience:
Weirdly I seen more when the Dreamachine was in complete darkness. I found it easier to immerse myself in the sounds and let the whole thing wash over me. I felt lots of things, hard to put into words, but that's part of the experience. Not everything can be, or needs to be put into words.
I feel like, as a meditative experience it was great. I don’t think enough people get a chance to experience meditation in such a personal way and I think this is a great way to bring meditation to new audiences. "
"1 To begin with when it went dark, anxious. Then relaxed with the pulsing ‘heartbeat’ - made me feel safe, like I was in the womb, aware of the outside world only with lights + sound.
2 Can’t say I enjoyed the louder, more overwhelming music, but I was in a relaxed state, awaiting the climax to relax again. It was stimulating, surprisingly.
3 The ‘helicopter’ sounds surrounding me I found enjoyable, transported me to feeling like I was lying in a daisy field and my son playing nearby me, but I was rooted to the ground, relaxed.
4 I felt on cusp of sleep, and loved the darkness at the end, and was surprised when it was over sooner than I expected.
5 Overall, I would try it again, to see how it compares once I know what to expect. I would likely feel more relaxed next time.  "
"There were periods of ‘nothing’ interspersed with a focus upon a fluid blot of blue and green ahead of me. This would change to a patterned grid of red lines. 

Movements of calm and “release”, I guess deep relaxation where I wasn’t really fully aware of my “being” - escape from my physical self. I can’t remember if I was trying to resist “letting go” of myself or if it had just happened. Hard to describe.

I feel very relaxed and reconnected again. 

Thank you. "
"There were some parts of the experience that resembled other situations; from daydreams, to early-morning-of-night antics, to float tanks. These were the more immersive parts that I enjoyed the most. Most of the time I had fleeting thoughts of worries or anxieties related to relationships or goals, to the backdrop of the experience. Which wasn’t as unpleasant as it sounds…
Thank you."
"There was a sense of movement as if at sea or near a beach.
In constant and fragile impressions as if the world was only travelling through wireframes of shapes constantly being wiped away by shaking kaleidoscopes leaving me in empty sky. 

There was also a disconnect between vision, hearing, on one hand, and my body on the other. My mind existing somewhere in between. It almost happened out of time. Only the occasional itch, need to clear my throat reminded me of where I was.

There was a feeling that my sense of objects and space was created as I attended to it like some sort of solipsist generation of the world, surfacing images and objects only stood as mathematical definitions."
"The sun on my face. The warmth washing over me.
Like I was watching an old fashioned carousel flicker lamp thing I don’t know the actual name for!
At one point the music sounded a little train-like and I felt like I was watching a train go by, a train of colours, all the colours.
I saw every colour. Sometimes all orange and then every colour in geometrics.
I felt like I saw it all through one (as in combined) eye which was awesome! 
I felt warm and calm and really content, which was unusual for me as normally I hate having my eyes closed in front of strangers.
I felt I retained control despite being in a vulnerable position.
It felt really nice. I felt really nice.
I couldn’t draw any of it and I don’t recognise anything anyone else has drawn as being what I saw! Which is strange but also lovely as it was just my experience."
"The space between life and death. Neither the start nor end - even though I tried to configure it. Horses ran in the beginning in a field which turned to water which evaporated. Then everything evaporated. Space felt uncontrollable and there were short spurts of the feeling of flying which stopped once I surrendered to the feeling. Goosebumps followed Happy moments. I cried, not in sadness but in realisation that I was seeing the inside of my mind. I hope everyone sees how beautiful they are, in the deep inside. The artist myself of shape and colour.
I am so grateful to the group of amazing humans who put this together. I cannot tell you how much I needed it. "
"Was going down tunnels, which were in really weird shapes.
Felt like I was spinning; and that my eyes were “open.”
At times, it was like the visions were undulating, like I was looking down at a surface of still water.
I had difficulty settling in at first but then I started getting immersed after a while.
At one stage I could see the number 8 and a butterfly. (Maybe I’m just overthinking?)
Near the end, it felt very peaceful. I think around this time I saw clouds of some sort."
"Initially I was overly conscious of the beating of my heart, my hands sweating and overloading my body with oxygen. As the lights began, I saw tufts of horizons, fluffy cloud-like shapes and corridors of light. In the periphery and sometimes crossing the centre of my vision were planet-like structures. Initially I took these visualisations at face value but soon the flashing combined with meditative breathing led to kind of automatic and then overwhelming thoughts.
I felt at peace in my conflict. Less perturbed about the experience my companions were having. At peace and in a position of acceptance.
The intelligent kinds of shapes and flashes led me to have a kind of cosmic peace balancing against this personal one. I am at a critical moment of change in my personal life.  I am re-considering the roles of the people around me and my own. This experience was intensely cathartic and therapeutic. It elicited a feeling of realisation about aspects of my childhood. I felt I had connected dots between aspects of myself and simultaneously I had been exposed to something of overwhelming beauty. I had the cry I needed. "
"I had several different experiences - kaleidoscopic and intense shapes, but also diving into wormholes and clear pictures of people and places (not ones I know).
I was surprised that it was music for the entire experience and not any soundscape.
I had no idea how long the experience was. It could have been 5 mins or 1 hour."
"Visual: Strong colours, sense of travelling through space, lots of tunnel movements that broke open impossibly.
Strong sense of personal colour palettes. Purple/blues moving into intense reds and yellows.
Mostly patterns but also occasional distinct realistic imagery for me, a phoenix insignia and a horse’s eye.
Feeling: Like I was touching forever, the vast expanse of space. Transcending time and mortality. 
Rising above myself. Powerful sense of serenity and calm."
"Initially I wasn’t sure that I would be able to handle the intensity of the light. As I began to adjust the experience started to become one of being on a warm sunlit beach with your eyes closed - the same warm feeling. The light experience oscillated between warm fuzzy feeling and light effects redolent of fireworks. Memories and light then began to interact in a lovely meditative experience. 
The combination of music, light and memory was lovely and felt as if I could almost talk to people I had lost in a very nice otherworldly feeling. "
"A kaleidoscope of colour/shapes
Felt that the sounds and light bathed me in a sense of calm and serenity.
Generated a sense of floating and being relaxed (Ended all too soon for me)
Detachment from space and time for a short period.
Think I saw quadratic equations which takes me back (way back in time).
Immersive and enjoyable experience."
"Feel relaxed like sitting under sunshine.
With the music and flashlight, the feeling changed to more like flying around the space.
Overall felt very relaxed. "
"I felt like I was going on a journey to outer space on an old style plane.
There was a lot of yellow which was warm and soothing like approaching the sun.
I felt at one point I breached the earth space barrier at one point.
It wasn’t a particularly enjoyable experience, very artificial compared to my nightly dreams."
"I felt back to childhood, receiving an X-mas gift of a kaleidoscope?
Fragmented pieces of colour rapidly changing shape. Also a ferris wheel or Catherine wheel with shafts of light covered in rainbow mosaic pieces. Once the music started to slow again, I saw half of a woman's face lying flat and her eyes very slowly closing.  "
"I saw the most beautiful colour I have ever seen.
It was like a mix of turquoise and teal, but more beautiful. It was towards the end when the music was slowing down. I wanted to swim in it.
Initially I thought I wasn’t ‘getting’ the experience. I was only seeing darker colours and I was scared, the fast lights would do something weird to my brain. But as it went on I started to see more and brighter colours. I liked when it was just a solid block of orange, then I focused in on the pixels which were pink, that changed into purple. 
Sometimes I thought I had my eyes open, but I hadn’t.
I could see things at the bottom, it was like I could see the people in the moon, but as a white silhouette on black, but I had my eyes closed."
It felt slightly disorientating initially but as I got used to it I felt like I was travelling through a portal. The colours shifted but I was always moving forward. It felt like I was being pulled through by some force. I found it kind of optimistic since nothing would last for too long. The visuals changing felt like a metaphor for life which is so fluid and changing constantly. The best we can do is relax and let this change happen since it will be beautiful as the change happens. 
"Grids of bright colours like the walls of a tunnel moving between rooms. Constant movement from room to room, slowly and quickly. Sometimes zooming and sometimes panning along the walls. As the music got faster, I did. When it settled, the colours (all except purple?) formed into a grid, more and more rigid until it faded to static. "
"See: grids, bright colours, shapes, numbers, letters, a chair.
On the side of the kaleidoscope were scenes with people, city scapes and landscapes.
In the centre always was a small circle with a face/ or a mouth or a dancing girl.
Very beautiful vivid colours, blues, greens, pinks and reds.
Felt: relaxed with a tingling in my abdomen and solar plexus, and my limbs felt light and my feet and ankles cold.
Think: enjoyed the experience - initially trying to make sense of what I saw but then just relaxed into it.
Apologies done without my glasses."
"Red /orange pure colours filling the space. Nice and warm like a sunset. Most of the experience was in the red colour spectrum, with disorganised shapes moving. I enjoyed just watching this ‘......’ of chaos fading back into white/black light. When this music grew louder on a few occasions shapes were organised and filled in a lot more space, 360 degree like vision. Then some yellow and pink arrived. Beautiful. Felt like the whole experience lasted only a couple minutes, I could have stayed a lot longer. The cleanest pattern came at the end as a sort of rotating tunnel with blue dots slowly pulsing moving forward in the tunnel.  "
"I felt the chains were really comfortable and I was totally relaxed. I felt that it was very difficult to feel submerged in the music at the start but felt that the music got louder and I was totally submerged. 
I definitely found it difficult to stay as ‘deep’ as I would have liked (I find it difficult not to think about what I should be doing at home) but as the music went on I felt so relaxed and found I was following my breathing and the music was nearly not even there. At the end I was really enjoying it and didn’t want it to end."
"I felt myself floating through space and time, at peace and light in body and mind. Space opened out infinitely before me and I seemed to be floating towards the centre of creation.
When I got to the centre I landed in a field, where I lay the grass and flowers warmed by the sun and totally at peace. 
Gradually the sunset and the warmth of the mood emerged signalling the end of the day and the journey. "
"I found the initial session very intense and that I couldn’t control the intensity. Then the longer session I could feel I could let it wash over me, the red and white guiding me. Then I began to feel I could control it and I moved my head to see a crystal of different colours - green + yellow and then finally it disappeared and a blue and purple light that was not either left or solid or ‘...’ - it was like nature and art - a science fiction religious experience."
"I felt like I had been lifted up far above the earth and could see vast mountain ranges and desserts. Then an intense feeling, almost like a mushroom explosion of colour
Red and white.
Then a vast spacescape full of tiny stars shooting across the sky the intensity was almost overwhelming until I moved my eyelids and I became able to accept the speed and changes of colour and shape. I began to feel warm and enveloped in this other world. The patterns changed from geometric to thistles and movement emanating from the centre of my sight. "
"It felt like speeding through time.
Through time
Peace exists
Tensions rise
Fire and water
Light and dark
Peace leaves
Time blurs 
Meaningless
But in the end
Peace returns."
"Rich gold light
Kaleidoscope patterns
Death of space above and beyond.

Frequency changes
Changing speed of light!
Shapes ever changing evolving
Detailed pattern
Buffering to darkness and all shades in between.
Mind racing to gentle flow.
Peaceful and full body experience. "
"Blasting off into the unknown
A panic; a rush
The calm, enveloping skin of the sea
Death
Uncomfortable purity
Mesmerising truth of existence."
"Loved it!
Colours I didn’t know existed.
Couldn’t stop smiling.
Thank you. "
"Like being born again, going through life and dying to be part of a whole again."
"The universe within.
Sacred geometry.
Photographs.
Sell the controls for the heat of the sun.
The totality.
Swirling tunnels
Conscious awareness
Spaciousness
A flower in a basket on a chair.
Coming and then going through.
Ancient Rome.
From immense to minute detail.
Colour can’t get brighter - then it does.
Thank you. "
"An almost overwhelming sense of calm, suspended in place. But also travelling faster than a human body should be able to. Touching the very corner of space and watching stars be born and die, an entire life cycle condensed into seconds. 
The colours were intense and shapes and patterns like liquid. Beautiful at a glance but impossible to grab onto tangible images, ‘staring’ too intensity made it shift form to something new. 
Even without the lights there was no blackness, softer more muted patterns swirled around my eyelids like fireflies, replacing the bright stars, which let my mind slow and travel back to earth with less weight than it had left with. "
"Reds and oranges as soon as the lights began to flash + sparks of white + silver.
Colours changed with more blues/purples/green. When light’s began to slow in intensity the colours changed to a fluorescent yellow, light purple and brown, in tiny regular shapes. 
So many shapes but all very regular. Many little hexagons/squares and even larger circles. Everything was regular and at many times the shapes flowed out from a central circle. Sometimes there were amazing circles + flashes in red and blues from the central point. Everything kept changing but the consistent thing was the regularity of the pattern.

I actually thought this is probably what a trip on L.S.D must have been like, psychedelic experience."
"Intense colour changes - covering every colour of the spectrum. 
The colours blended together then began to spin - almost like looking through a kaleidoscope then looking through another kaleidoscope and another… and another…

It was nearly too intense but the intensity broke and I was bathed in colour, pattern and light.

I lost my dad at the start of the year and this almost felt like I was travelling back to him through light - through a tunnel of shapes that would give way to a spinning rainbow of colour… just beautiful!"
"I started in a warm beautiful serene space the light was bright and solid and I was floating through it, then it changed to blue and I was taken on a journey speeding through a tunnel. The tunnel took me into different worlds I would see them from a far and then go down into them and into the streets or the area before it would move me back up and pull me far away again taking me in another direction, I saw a desert city silhouette and then what looked like the world from a far then closer and into another direction. All in all it felt like I was on a journey outside of my body guided around places I could never go physically. So hard to describe but it was beautiful. I followed a light and an eye in the distance grew larger and larger and then disappeared again."
"Alone in impossible space like my eyes were open and couldn’t close
Sometimes the dark was as intense as the strobing lights, seeing flashes of white grids.
Felt warmth when I saw something I perceived as sunlight.
Saw something like the edges of cogs but not like machinery, more organic. Difficult to disconnect from a feeling of fear and anxiety, becoming very aware of the tension I hold in my body. Trying to find the tether of my own breath and following it through more abstract moments. A sense of relief that I can find myself in the dark.  "
"I had my eyes closed for the majority of the experience, only opening them occasionally and briefly to check on the colour of the lights. I felt very relaxed and at peace throughout and the recommended breathing exercise helped to bring my thoughts back into the room."
"During my experience I saw and felt a person, I seen from that perspective water + diving in and out trying to reach something but each time it got close it disappeared into a water tornado like thing that was red + orange.

I felt as though each dive into water was a conscious search and a need to find the item.

Side note also heard a spaceship. "
"At first I saw single colours, reds, yellows and oranges. Then a mixture of moving patterns they kept changing and it already feels hard to remember. I also think I jumped the sensation when you falling asleep and jolt. I wasn’t sure if it was the chair or me. The shapes and patterns kept changing and moving in different ways. I have no concept of the length of time. "
"Reminds me of 1970’s top of the pops. With the off chance that Mike Oldfield was going to start Tubular Bells I would be more interested in the mechanics of the effect i.e how the brain interacts with the sound to produce the images. No structure to the images, more a series of ‘......’. Images with no design. "
"Strips like reels of an old movie tape, lights down a motorway or rings of Saturn. Moving and spiralling like a portal. Real sense of moving up and down and around with it. The paths were filled with star shapes. This would change to flashing pointed checks at points, sometimes with a bright red cross in the middle. There would speed up and get rather anxiety inducing, before changing back to the trips. "
"See - darkness then drawn into white light ending up in an apple blossom orchid 
Feel - intense heat, emotion, then calm 
Think - Drawn towards a distant white light 
"
"My mind chattered incessantly for quite some time - as it usually does - I tried to be kind to myself and not feel frustrated. For the first time in so long I allowed myself to be still. The magic calmed me and I felt peaceful. I feel incredibly sad that it has ended - I could have sat there for hours as though my mind continued to chatter. I still felt peaceful inside. It was more a sense of grounding I felt, rather than a visual experience. Though I hadn’t expected to “see” the people around me through closed eyelids. A wonderful experience and i’m not looking forward to going back out in this crazy noisy world. Thank you for creating this safe, peaceful, wonderful space and experience. "
"Initially the patterns created by the light were very kaleidoscopic and other-worldly. They ranged from ones which felt very natural, almost nature like though perhaps like that on another planet - like the growth and booming of alien plants. To ones which felt almost technological kind of reminding me of 70s sci-fi, films, very structured patterns coming to life. 

At one point I wasn’t sure if i’d fallen asleep but when I “woke up” the experience had completely changed. It was now much more calm and serene. From this point on everything felt like hazy film scene or memories where i was at the cameras POV. At one point I saw a hazy background of calm colours with the sort of ghost like ferns of firemen walking across the corner of my vision. They were only energy forms, made of colour yet still distinguishable. One other example was a hazy background where I could just make out cars drving across the distance.
"
"Planes of kaleidoscopic bubbles and vectors with occasionally _______
Occasional senses of vastness and infinite space; dissolution of the senses of place but that was brief. Wheels of kaleidoscopic colours spinning and wheeling in different directions all moving through a longer space. At times there was a strong focal point with vectors moving rapidly towards or away from it. At most times I still felt centred and completely to my own body and bounded by myself own fields of vision. But occasionally these dissolved. The whole thing only felt like it lasted a few minutes but looking at my watch I realised it must have been about 20 minutes the neverending sensation was one of fun and adventure. 
"
"It shoogled my core, breathe, relax, heavy, my own eye, receding, gazing at me, morphed into eyes of those lost - looking at me with peace and absolute lobe. Plunged into darkness - memories of dark night, everyone asleep, surrounded by love and safety. Walking in a pine wood in Lithuania - spot of light through the dark trees but wanting to stay in the darkness. Aware but unaware - safe fleeting memories of meals and not real. Trying to think and connect, trying not to think and disconnect. "
"Once I relaxed more, I could start to see moments in the different light ie Blue - Deep felt I was in the deep ocean, maybe in a craft moving along. Red definitely seemed like I was travelling inside the body down tubes (likes endoscope - inside blood vessels - bloods flowing - at fust was going down travelling with the flow. After different light changes the red - I was coming back out. My brain eventually was quiet when it was seeing these was like when you see pictures in the clouds. Very relaxing experience - Thank you. "
"I felt I was inside a Kaleidoscope with lots of bright colour combinations - bright orange red and green purple and green very bright blue.
Lots of ______ and repeating ____
Textures, like ______ it embossed wallpaper. 
I had little micro dreams - _____ about the colour of wall paper, a mild apartment with a friend.
Positive, colourful experience - did I really make all that up? 
"
Spiralling Inwards / Outwards a multicoloured kaleidoscopes of colours. Travelling through time + space. Communing with a female (unknown to me) 
"Galaxies unfolding, planets, shapes locked & connected. I saw one spider in the middle of all the light, I think this represents fear but I lent into it, the spider disappeared then the galaxies returned infinite shapes & stars & life spilling out into the open."
"
Deep relaxation & sense of peace ____ shapes in patterns sometimes moving across vision but mostly moving out from or in towards a central point. Between the shimmering patterns and overall patterns like pictures of very starry skies moving towards you a lot of purple, red, one brilliant blue, some lovely overall yellow like sun, green predominantly, purple.
"
In the taster I felt panic and had to concentrate on breathing. Within the main experience I felt calm although colours + feeling were more red+ blacks I saw a crucifix + fire like colours with black tree like images at the bottom. 
"Kaleidoscope feeling - bit hippy quite intense parts 
Different waves - lots of colours + directions (droplets)
Different waves - lots of colours + directions 
Interchangeable 
Quite spiritual

"Euphoric
Joyful 
Ecstatic 
In space
Swimming 
Flying 
Dancing
Wanting to move
Want to stay 
Like the time we took LSD and disappeared into out magic eye
"
At start while light bery strong then as got used to space. Music + beat resounding in my ears. Body moved or feet moved to the beat. Feeling more + more relaxed. Light and sound creating symbols around them - lots of coloured shapes blending + changing feeling more relaxed. Music at end chilling me out.
"Although the strobe lighting was a bit painful, the patterns were incredible. What you see is a simplified “greatest hits” spinning spheres, tunnels, fractal patterns, geometric lines even an intricate circuit board. There was light beyond the tunnel ends and hints of a building wall behind the patterns. It would take a series of __ to do justice to what I saw. A whole gallery! Shifting patterns, a sense of travelling in dimensions, like Dr Strange."
"
Truly amazing. Colours I never thought existed shining so brightly. Shapes of all types patterns floating in a swarm of directions. Leading me one way then pulling me another. Even in parts where it could become overwhelming I felt safe. After a flurry of patterns it would take me back to 1 of 3 scenes then begin again. 
"
"At first it felt like the Sun coming out very soothing then the flashing lights were really intense and I saw shapes forming behind my eyes moving quickly I would describe the movement as undulating. I found the experience very emotional and it made me cry - but not in a “sad” way. It brought up feelings of two pregnancies that were never born and the conflicting emotions around that. Some grief, but mainly just have an acceptance for them and also for myself. It was very profound."
"I felt fully immersed in my Hypnagogic visions. As though flying through a Stan Brakhage film closed eye cinema at its finest. Warm. Comforting, intimate yet universal. Nice to feel a part of something. 
"
Completely present yet far away. Embraced by colours and shapes yet not looking at all.
"At times I felt like I was on a rollercoaster when the light was flashing rapidly
And then it was still and come and I feel at peace
I meditate regularly and I found the sense of peace and mental and bodily changing that I feel when I meditate
I found breathing call me when the light We are flashing so that they didn’t make me anxious what I can see how some people can get quite anxious I loved it was really joyful! 
"
"A shift in consciousness almost like astral travelling through a portal of sacred geometric shapes, kaleidoscope shapes. lifted out of body and felt “at one” with universe - became pure consciousness, aware of everyone, everything all at once. was reminded of a time and place - ancient yet familiar above Earth a place of higher dimension, higher purpose and pure peace 
"
"It felt like being inside a globe – a kaleidoscopic globe
The colours and patterns were constantly changing sometimes I saw orange clouds other times I saw shop jagged waves flashing and swirling around me.
Very synaesthetic!
Who is usually a centre point that everything revolves around a diamond or circle in the middle
I experience synesthesia but the visualisations were in addition to this the synesthesia visualisation of the music
I had no idea how long it lasted… 
"
"Really powerful. magical colours. it took me to a different universe - which I felt one with. I felt part of the music as though I belong with a huge happiness. It could have lasted longer to really become one with it

At the point where the music takes you to a very powerful place there is a feeling of being taken to an amazing place + just as you get there the music pulls back I was really happy about being taken to this place as I felt safe – but then when it stopped quickly-I felt a bit used as if my trust and experience had been a bit manipulated for the dream machine experience as a personal experience I would’ve ————- the powerful part I transitioned on before falling back thank you
"
"A kaleidoscope of colours during the strobe phase mainly during the constant light those becoming purple blue geometric patterns radiating from central point during the strobe than forcing in time of the music the lights find myself drifting off mainly relaxing
"
"I saw fractal geometric shapes of red and purple the focused into a point like a tunnel constantly vibrating other times it was a peach colour that had bright pink blobs that undulated.
then it was as if I was under a puddle in a rain shower watching the ripples on the water surface while the sky drifted away…
I’m sure I drifted into dreams and felt I was at home until the music bought me back.
there were shapes like round jigsaw puzzles that some shapes dropped behind and turned on the axes
it felt safe calm and cathartic
 thank you
"
"It was an overwhelming of my senses I was transported from realm to realm, not just because of the changing colours I was seeing but because of the twisting and shifting shapes and structures as well. It felt urban, messy and mystical. I saw a statue of a woman come into my eye line from the right eager to enter the madness no doubt, weirdly familiar like a heightened reality. this would be life if we saw in technicolor.
"
"Bathed in warm orange like sunshine breaking up into patterns of red and turquoise pulsating cubes silver snowflakes against a red background and falling into deep puddles with blue and at the very end finally green and pink central figure blooming like a rose with the petals falling out words onto a yellow background finished in a sort of warm like bath.

During the experience, I felt my awareness of my body receipt, my discomfort I’ve wet thunderstorm outside trousers changed to a sensation of warmth, comfort and stillness. All my anxiety about the day melted away and I felt very in the moment, not really thinking about anything, just enjoying the experience and surrendering myself to it.
"
"Very bright deep colours. ______ Patterns. Webs and grids of pattern sometimes round or ____ 
By scrunching eyelids or moving eyes up and down side to side it seemed able to effect and renew the patterns. Towards the end the pattern seem to be responding quite closely to the rhythms of the music. Fun and relaxed lots of questions – how would deaf people respond? What about people with only black and white version? Etc
"
"I saw many different shapes and colours, sometimes I felt I was travelling forward, sometimes backwards, up or down. At some point it felt that something was rushing past me Like being on a train station platform. It made me feel quite peaceful and at some point it was exciting. It was at times like being in a giant kaleidoscope. It was beautiful. When the light became extremely bright it was like flying near the Sun. It was like travelling through space and it had a peaceful and spiritual element for me. Sometimes I felt that there were crowds of people moving quickly around. I really enjoyed the experience and feel that It helped to calm my anxiety. It would be good if we could own portable versions to use at home."
"I saw different shapes and focus in different colours, depending on the speed of the flashes. Furthermore, the shapes and colours changed moving my eyes into different directions. "
"I felt quite anxious at the start until I relaxed into it.
The colours were so intense - peacock blues + greens.
I felt like I was in a tunnel heading towards a round purple light.
Then it was like being in a centrifuge - spinning + spinning (a bit like my life!)
I felt so relaxed at the end. "
"Pulled into a space, drawn towards a force, pushed forward - feeling of moving and travelling while colours and shapes explode around me. Felt warm and safe, uncomfortable with the journey. Very stark change of colour from navy to very bright pink. Shapes from stars and squares to dots, spirals explosions. Moving forwards in a positive way. A journey in a time warp. Class!! "
"Lots of different colours and shapes flowing into each other, always a centre piece shape that would keep pulling in and out. Felt like I was exploring a lot of lights in the sky. Kept seeing a large face in the corner of the view, popping in and out of it.  "
I saw lots of colourful geometric shapes. It was extremely flashy - they were not continuous. I had to use the eye mask as it was too flashy and bright. I only experienced the first few minutes. I also saw an 1800's lady in white sun hat and dress. I think I am maybe sensitive to bright light.
"Thoughts like clouds
Sometimes think I’m making them really
I’m making it an image.
Geometric shapes.
Intensity shaped with speed + music as speed + volume of music intensified felt like I was ‘coming up’ hard to gauge time passing.
Did not feel a group experience. Whilst it was happening I felt like I was on a space on my own.
Felt a bit like taking ecstasy."
Beautiful colours. Mainly orange. Beautiful orange in tele shapes moving off on the left side. Beautiful magenta and green in soft oblong shapes moving in slow soothing motion. Just saw beautiful colours. Colours like I’d never seen the beauty of colour before.
"It was like watching a winamp ‘Milkdrop’ visualiser - it put me right back to the days of Napster and the early web. I wanted to open my eyes to see how this is achieved, but I wasn’t brave enough!"
"Very intense colours, shapes and geometric patterns
Aware of patterns moving clockwise and then anti clockwise.
I felt very safe + comfortable. At some points it was like standing in the desert very bright and warm then being transported to distant galaxies.
A very enjoyable experience.
Thank you."
"Very relaxing. Moves everything and then lets it go. Was deeply peaceful, fully immersive experience. Found even things  that could not be moved or let go and moved them, let them go. It was fully absorbing physically yet completely mental experience. "
"A very comfortable, laid back seat on soft material. Feet resting and speakers of each ear. A dark room with a huge centre ceiling light which changed. Soothing sounds played with moments of dramatic sounds. Ideal time to switch off the real world and rest. Time to reflect and listen to your thoughts."
"After the light experience yesterday. I came back to do the listening experience, I saw a calmer version of the visuals. It reminds me of an intense meditative state, but much easier to get into.
I saw the same eye I witnessed yesterday. Perhaps it is trying to tell me something or guide me to something. "
"Inside and kaleidoscope
Sense of euphoria
Reminder of trance
Blade runner movie vibes.
Therapeutic mostly though uptight to.
Felt vibrations.
Doctor Who opening sequence tunnels.
Orbital travel. 
Interference on a tv screen.
Like a soothing slowed down firework.
Like when you get eyes tested and shine light on another level.
Immersive sensory experience. "
"I think I failed to get fully immersed in the experience, possibly because I kept my eyes open (I thought that was an alternative given - open or closed). Was relaxing and somewhat engrossing and the audio was immersive, but I remained on “normal” consciousness throughout. Great music though. "
"A journey through a kaleidoscope. With a backdrop layer of town layout. 
Heavy weighted hands with release.
A couple of intense bright lines of red and green lights, almost arcade like (‘.....’)."
"Squares shapes to circle shapes. Rode on horseback underwater
Space to underwater
Being in space circling tower, moved into the tower, tower shape became a stream of shapes, each shape contained a shape. Motion became more important; became a particle moving through light/water. "
"Mostly reds in various forms, with flashing boxes moving in a central box.
Also blue and white bubbles, almost cloud-like, especially towards the end. The best bit for me was the slowing, staccato-type music which ended in a relaxed period. "
"Halo of light always (patterns coming out of it) in centre of vision
Dots
Lots repeating patterns (tremble and wallop)
Mostly patterns but sometimes became a thing e.g a shoal of mackerel spinning around me. "
It’s exactly what I imagine ‘tripping’ in a nightclub to be like (without ever having taken drugs) but pleasant. I loved the relaxing element of it and the calming effect. It’s definitely a very positive experience. 
"Very bright to start
All one, slow at start
Lots of red, blue colours - like a kaleidoscope you had as a child - all going into or coming out from a centre point. "
"Like being in space, and then underwater, and then inside the human brain. Shades of grey in geometric shapes that looked very ‘70’s sci-fi’. Blue waves from above and then below, like being first above the ocean and then in it. Scenes of space scattered with stars and space dust. The way science books describe the birth of the universe. Angry red flashes, only briefly, that fade to grey and then to black. Geometric shapes that spin and turn to stars. "
Was not for me at all. The lights were a lot brighter + intense than I expected. The flashing was too much but I tried to stick with it. The eye mask does not help with blocking any light out. I felt like the lights were very bright and warm especially towards the pineal gland aka the 3rd eye. Definitely would not try again. Staff friendly + did ask everyone if they were ok to continue.
Patterns like the ceiling of the alhambra / islamic tilework and lattice.
"The fractals that I saw was incredible the most was crossed arches with nodes of light, and some black nodes. At some point I felt like fall asleep but not completely was like on and off. The experience was so relaxing and the music is and light create the patterns together."
"It was a lot. But I would do it again too/ my head felt warm and bright.
It was fast and fun
My experience felt peaceful and relaxing it felt like leaving a trace of oneself in the DREAMACHINE."
"I’m glad I’m coming back. As I felt like I fell asleep and missed a lot of it.
Thank you for removing my phone from me that was therapeutic in itself.
Like the removal of spirit animals in the golden compass but in a good way. "
"At stages I felt extreme cold. Not panicked in any way however it was throughout my entire body.
Moments of high levels of energy without the need to get up or move or speak.
Overall calm and chilled feeling. However felt like I couldn’t completely be in the moment and kept being drawn to the music/sounds around me.
Saw moving objects like birds/fish/waves. "
"Relaxed, deep state of mind. Very colourful. Almost like walking through a different dimension of the universe. Colours were very fast paced and different shapes. Sometimes it felt like they were moving towards you, other times like they were going away from you but still felt very relaxed and conscious within the experience. Very calming."
Everytime we started it was orange like the sun + got more intense with the music then a series of shapes - geometric and lines in different colours. Some of the colours were ones I had never seen before. 
"This was a very relaxing, enjoyable experience. It was a very calming colourful experience that allowed me to process my thoughts and feelings. When I found my mind drifting, the lights, colours + shapes brought me back to myself. "
"A kaleidoscope of pastels
Blue infinity
The most beautiful green
Peace and calm."
"I saw huge waves consuming a city, the Giants causeway.
Then I was transported to an empty graveyard in a desert where giant figures were bowing down to something"
"It was all blue, pink and purple.
I felt all of the thoughts of the past week kept rushing through my mind until it was emptied. Until I started seeing doors, the openings, the eye and the tentacles. They were all connected. 
It went from very sharp forms to more fluid ones.
It felt good! "
"A very relaxing and hypnotic experience that draws you into your senses and escape from your surroundings. I saw a series of small, flashing squares at the centre which gradually faded towards the periphery and beyond. At points, there were spirals and oral shapes, again moving from the centre to the outside. As unique and worthwhile experience! "
"I could see through my eyelids and a few times questioned whether my eyes were actually shut.
I felt deeply moved and emotional especially during the taster and first half of the dream machine experience.
I felt like what I was seeing was right in front of me in the room. "
"Orange empty relax 
Clear music is quite fresh. Make me less stressful and I always will have too much unconscious information full of my head which cannot stop. But the light and the sound helped me to have more rhythmical, timely thinking, and release the burden and everything feeling out of my mind.
For me, the light and sound helped the sensory to go inside my mind not in a rush, so I have more time to think and analyse myself."
"Beautiful geometrical shapes moving with the sound. The main colours were orange and blue, some red “pois” and green.
When music and lights were moving to fast, I felt a bit sick. I didn’t sleep, but yes “away” at some point…"
"Felt very overwhelmed at some points. I saw lots of colours but most vividly remember seeing spinning - umbrella - shaped wheels, and a blue aura reminiscent of a rave.
It is very remarkable how our brains attempt to fill in gaps in information. "
"Lots of colours, shapes moving fast. The geometric shapes appeared fast and moved fast. I didn’t see much defined imagery of objects I know, but I enjoyed the patterns and the imagination."
"Upward squirting light and sections. 
Lots of water and underwater feelings and sensations.
The music was very rhythmic and watched the patterns in my head perfectly. "
"Initially the experience felt quite uncomfortable but once I controlled and concentrated on my breathing and simply let the images wash over me rather than trying to make sense of them, it was relaxing by concentrating on my breathing the flow of my brain was not on the images. 
Strangely the very bright tangerine orange which was threatening at the beginning was relaxing at the end.
I saw all the colours of the spectrum mainly in patterns with only two brief repeats ______ Tree like structure in a giant grid, Once arranged horizontally and vertically. I only saw one face ____ And which was absorbed by the mud.

"At first it was mostly fractals & coloured patterns, I saw a lot of tunnels & it was quite disorientating. I saw traintracks in green & purple, and trains going past with windows of eyes Dragon with armour. 
Surrender. 
The sun.
The park in southampton with James.
I got teary with an overwhelming feeling of love. He was the only other person that came to mind. Light through grasses and fresh air. Then it went dark & blue. I saw a boat, like a canoe, but I was underwater - but I couldn’t seem to cross the boundary between the water and the sky outside out of it I didn’t know why.

"Im from Argentina and this was the best experience I have ever been. I was smiling during the hole time! To be honest I feel happiness, Joy and all these beautiful feelings made me cry but ins the most beautiful way. Feeling that I’m in my own trip, with all these colors, patterns, shapes, movements (honestly. I felt that I was floating in the space) and stars. 'as well. I felt (and still feeling ) all this Joy, : it seems like nothing bad it's going to happen, I have that control and I had it during the experience with my breathe, my soul, floating in army universe, my own brain. Thank you so much! The  world needs this! I'll re remember this beautiful experience all my life

"It felt as if I could sense then light moving across my body and the room. Weird to physically fool feel light. The majority of the colours I saw ere warm ones. Red, orange, pink. Very lovely, blue, green and purple (my favourite colors)

When the light was bright I’d see a single line or gradient of colours. During flashing there was a lot of movement, vibration and geometrical shapes and lines. I was most surprised over seeing white, shades of grey and black shapes vibrating. There was often red, pink or orange lines across these. 
"
Mostly one recurring pattern - a starburst shape. Not too many variations of colour. Mostly Blue/Black and Red or Blue/Black and white. Occasionally converging half-tone patterns. 
My mind went clean my body was so calm & still. I felt relaxed + rested. My worries went away after a dew minutes. Saw colours i’d seen before. 
"Only upon reflection I realised I’d reached a moment of what I'd describe as true peace. In the centre of a geometric, spinning square was a glowing egg - lots of little geletenous blobs with pure sunlight radiating from it but also rushing into it. I thought that the egg was the most important thing to exist - it was the purest lifeform. Obersering some sort of universal birth. Lost all sense of time, I observed many crucifix shapes shootings away from the egg."
"Colourful sound waves, experimental patterns and blobs of suspended colour blending into each other. At times I felt like I was seeing sound waves on water but it was colourful. It vibrated as it shifted across. My vision. It went quickly."
I could both feel and see people getting up and moving away from me and walking. Into deserts and palaces built up out of geometric shapes. As they got further away they became one with the shapes. At first this was quite disconcerting but then it started to become quite peaceful and beautiful. 
Spinning symmetry. Nebulas of blue & green. Blue & red spots forming a heart. Swirling circles at the centre of swirls. 2 experiences at once - one dreaming one watching colours and shapes spin.
"Complex grid of interlocking shapes
Very angular shapes like stars and hexagons tunnels – travelling very fast through these boats towards and away from the centre.
It felt like there were architectural structures behind the sea of shapes and colours, like black and white line drawings on a sheet was buildings.
Little behind the colours it was like a helicopter set a circumnavigate on the top of a mountain.
These more literal images appear difficult to see behind these shapes, almost like a magic eye puzzle."
"It was deeply relaxing when you settled into the space. The noise and light was not as intense as expected. The facilitators Support with breathing was helpful – divisions were fascinating kaleidoscope type version will it range of colours. Red/green. Blue/purple. Orange and pink and red. Interlocking shapes of diamonds and hexagons, pentagons and circles mosaics ____________ increased in intensity of vision speed of movement I think amazing experience that I’ll definitely try again.

"
"I felt almost like in an out of body experience. Sometimes like I was spinning, almost falling backwards. Exactly like being in – or just being – a kaleidoscope. Different colours coming towards me one after the other. A little blue shape featured a lot. Bright white dots everywhere. And then a bright white stripe crossing across – almost like splitting a galaxy in half. Like floating through the cosmos. I felt elated (almost like how I would imagine on psychedelics although I don’t know what this is like in reality!) Sometimes I ask myself if my eyes were open or even shut as I was seeing so many things!

"Spinning targets – circles with horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines.
Often symmetrical. Sometimes elliptical as if watching the disc from a different angle.
Occasionally grey falling snow and three shapes at the start of a sequence for a few seconds before the spinning targets appeared.
It felt a bit overwhelming/dizzy the first few times the flashing light started but it was peaceful when used to it.
I always felt fairly conscious of the experience and observing it rather than being lost in it."
"Flying through space
 lots of colourful tunnels of different shapes circles, hexagon very bright Sky
 felt like a backwards roller coaster halfway through
 very strong pinks, blues
 felt like I was underneath the ocean for a little bit
 slight strange sensation were the very bright lights would trigger a vibration in my right ear
 everything was sparkly and spongy looking

It felt overwhelming, too much to take in. Busy. Hectic. Intense. Crazy. Very bright + uncomfortable @ times. Kept seeing an eye. Felt like my own eye from the inside.

"A lot of pulsing geometric patterns - sequences, lots of different colours - I liked the warm yellow light best. I didn’t like it’s fast pulsing centre colours - often green, reds, violets + blues. At times there seemed to be outlet pattern moving at a different pace to main block. The sounds matched the pulsing lights & was most enjoyable. "
"Felt warmth
Daylight and nighttime - cityscape
Spirals and stars
Felt like I was floating in the sea at one point 
"
"It was awesome!
I felt like I was moving forwards then backwards through space. 
The music crescendoed + it went mental, then it was like water washing over me + went a beautiful blue/purple colour, with tiny white moving lights.
I want to try this at home!!
Thanks "
"I had several different experiences - kaleidoscopic and intense shapes, but also diving into wormholes and clear pictures of people and places (not ones I know!)
I was surprised that it was music for the entire experience and not any soundscape.
I had no idea how long the experience was. It could have been 5 mins or 1 hour."
"I saw lots of blue symmetrical lights. Very fluid movements an if I was watching something underwater.
I thought the music was absolutely beautiful, it made me feel very heavy and relaxed.
My whole body was in sync with my breathing. 
A fantastic experience - thank you."
"At the beginning I was swimming in a rusty orange, sunlit pool of water. At other points it was like being on a kaleidoscope roller coaster, floating through a space highway. I wasn't really fast, with lots of lines moving in different directions - a bit like drunken room - spinning. There were also mellow, gentle moments of pulsing or rising lights, and I noticed the shapes moving in time to the music. "
"Lots of things like the graphics on shadertoy - perlin noise-esq + inference patterns.
Almost too intense noise at first, lots of spinning forms, at the end lots of green and orange.
(Ispend lots of time looking at graphics - the demoscene, + fractals  + this seemed to influence what Ii saw) "
"Intense lights and shapes. Hexagons in blue and red. Then almost kaleidoscope like sometimes saw grey (black + white?!) clouds/smoke and some statuesque figures.
Towards the end, when the lights stopped, I felt like I could see sound waves in green. And then a sort of purple “root” with branches coming off in all directions. Sort of like ballet. "
"At one point I felt occurrences of my feet connecting to the ground.
I felt at peace and relaxed
I was amazed at what the mind could produce
I saw dancing light, patterns and tunnels
I felt that everything is going to be ok
I envisioned my future
I heard helicopters and trains in the rhythm of the music"
"I saw mainly tunnels with light that I was moving through. They tended to be in the centre of my vision. Interestingly moving my eyes to different areas caused the centre of the tunnel to move with the eye. 
At one point it seemed we were moving through clouds into the atmosphere of a planet.
When the light stopped for a period I saw thousands of particles falling away. "
"I was thinking about the trees blowed by wind, the sunshine, and the blue sky. I felt calm and relaxed. I can barely remember what I was thinking during the whole process. I was in half sleepy and half awake mode. "
"Saw many bright colours, all except green in a pattern which was constantly moving.
Had many geometric shapes forming vertical lines, or 6 lines moving out from the centre which often formed a shape such as an eye or many hexagons (like JWST). Overall very immersive, and the music was incredible!"
"Euphoric. I couldn’t stop myself from smiling.
Both connected to my body, and out of my body.
Started to see figures, tall people at the corners of my vision.
Colours, shapes, like fantasia in my brain.
Happy that my brain could make something so beautiful.
Therapeutic. "
"I saw the shape of a heart many times in several different colours.
I saw the detailed figures of 4 people's shoulders to head. Old man, old lady, 2 children male and female. 
So many colours. Hexagons, pentagons, etc.
I saw waves of colour + shape.
At one stage I saw purple and pink squares surrounded by mannequin type figures. I saw shapes swimming. Many geometric shapes like a kaleidoscope.
Colour movement.
I felt emotional throughout, very happy, tearful + then extremely relaxed. "
"Amazing!! Thank you dreamachine! 
So many colours!! Second time of the Dreamachine and incredible how both experiences are so different! One of life’s wonders! Thank you!"
"Out of body experience, hard to describe so many colours and images within one space.
I felt relaxed and totally aware of myself within the space. 
Feeling of falling or travelling at times. "
"Relaxed  optimistic
Sucked in  smiling
Floating  alert
Sense of being held/supported
Mind cleared
Thought about my hands + feet.
Saw a lot of geometric shapes.
Main colours green, yellow, orange, purple. 
Felt sucked into a central point like a vortex, or a doughnut, circle or hole.
Seemed to be free of thinking during it - relief. "
"Felt a real adventurous + explorative experience as the movement, colours + transitions of light pushed my mind to answer + fill in the gaps.

Tried to control the experience initially, however soon realised this created anxiousness + so released myself + opened my mind to allowing it to take, wander off in its own direction.
Felt like I was watching my mind work."
"Lots of red and orange mosaic patterns. 
It looked like a kaleidoscope that kept changing.
It felt like my eyes were opening or open but checked and they weren’t.
It felt like you were moving through a portal. "
After the first few minutes it felt like I was falling into a portal that kept enveloping me more deeply and surrounding me more. 
"A beautiful, warm, safe, calm experience."
Relaxed but also invigorated. Detached from my body. Empowered. 
"At the beginning a little anxious. Overtime I went with the flow and sat back and enjoyed it. Different coloured splodges pulsed with a shape in the middle, a cross that changed and spun, and tunnelled into a disc. At points I was moving through it like in 2001 a space Odyssey. At times I felt I could control how these shapes moved in which direction and their size but I decided to stop trying to control with it and go for it. "
"The breathing settled my mind, my body, to acceptance of the unknown - what was to come. No fear. No concern, just acceptance and willingness.
The experience was surreal, yet welcoming, enveloping. Colours and patterns I could never envisage, you visualise. Such beauty. Such peace. An experience like no other. A welcome experience that ended almost too soon, one that almost insists on my return. It certainly has a call!"
"I felt like I was going through a passage; an afterlife passage. I saw lights of all colours and shapes, throughout these lights I felt the sensation of end and beginning. Turmoil and peace, I felt through colours positive and negative feelings, I felt a pathway to another dimension/world and towards the end I felt an immense sensation of peace as the blue light came ‘......’. Like I had a mission that was being accomplished."
"I felt really relaxed and weightless, at the end I became really aware of what was going on in my body, i.e some stomach, as if it was amplified all of a sudden.
I saw mostly squares, neon colours. It alternated between bright warm colours like peach, pinks and red and black backgrounds with neon blue and green when it went blue. It felt like the bottom of the sea. "
"I felt the fear thinking lights took over and were too quick and unsettling. Felt my brain couldn’t keep up.
Covered my eyes then and felt the music was restful and exhilarating at different times in equal measure.
Didn’t enjoy the light experience. 
Enjoyed the music. "
"My grandfather and brother recently passed and I saw them and my granda stuck his tongue out and sean was dancing to the frequency, see some memories. Also seen some African girl, she was a teenager. Heard that I need to let go and live my life. Felt peaceful and also felt like I was going through a tunnel."
"Saw lots of lights all colours. Red, yellow, blue, like a pupil of an eye.
Spiralling lights dark then becoming smaller and lighter, moving in and out towards me then away again. Very relaxed, body was very very heavy, felt if asked to move or get up I could not.
Felt music was a bit loud “well for me anyhow”.
Very relaxing experience.
Thank you."
"At first - I was worried I would be overwhelmed. My breathing then slowed + I melt into my seat - and the experience. It took me a while to be fully immersed but when I was - I didn’t want to leave.
I almost felt like I could see while my eyes were closed - the reality of the room merged with the lights. The lights and shapes were really abstract but somehow coordinated. Almost like a kaleidoscope. I came out of the experience relaxed and refreshed, reflective and appreciative of the shared group experience. "
"Hexagonal spirals spinning out from a ‘......’ centre. Blue structures filled with bright pea green colour.
Had a sensation as if I was coming to the surface after being underwater, a bit like diving down then surfacing. 
Greens and blues seem to be the dominant colours I saw. "
"Initially felt anxious/packicked during the visuals. During the main experience I started to relax - I felt at times I was under a hot sun on a beach. Other times it felt like space waves. It made me feel I was in a sci-fi novel - Dune, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Star wars. I didn’t relax and felt present the whole time - it caused my hands and fingers to move a lot uncontrollably - felt like a kaleidoscope. Really enjoyed the music the whole way through. "
"""An extreme euphoric experience (at points outer body) 
Very relaxed and soulful - afterwards it took over 30 minutes to regain/come back to my body.
A haze like phase - totally relaxed and at peace.
Various emotions and patterns/colours.
An absolute treat!
Very healing and positive! 
Bliss! """
"Felt like walking into heaven!
Lots of tiles of colour and made me feel like I was gaining clarity. 
I do not think I fell asleep but I have little memory of the last 5-10 minutes as I was in a deep state of relaxation. I kept thinking of the movie American beauty and the scene the main character dies and looks back at scenes of his life passing by quickly. "
"I saw bright orange then blue and orange combined into geometric shapes, all moving very fast. I saw some purple shapes at times. At one point I think I saw a small jack russell dog’s face in the centre which changed into something else, maybe a horse’s face then back to geometric shapes. It was very relaxing and at one point I think I fell asleep then came back. Even during the blackness I saw like a mist and purple lined shapes swirling around. I heard ‘external’ noises at one point which was distracting. It was very relaxing and peaceful and not as loud as I had anticipated. Lovely experience. "
"I felt distracted but very relaxed - thinking about a lot of things that are annoying me.
A lot of colour - pink, orange, green/blue.
Saw starry sky, stars moving in the corners a couple of times.
A lot of geometric shapes
Thoughts of a savanna - trees, animals etc but I don’t think I saw that.
Saw a chessboard in the centre for a tiny bit.
ASMR tingly brain LOL.
There were external noises that were distracting (sounded like marbles dropping?)"
"Everything started off orange and yellow and white. Felt like the birth of a star. Very much an elemental of warmth. Moved onto almost a vortex of very 80’s vapour wave colours. Midway through I was almost reliving scenes in my head. I moved from visualising colours and fractal patterns to real life scenes. I have very little recollection of what scenes exactly I was imagining.
At one stage there was also intense blues, almost like being under water, incredibly deep, seeing how I would imagine deep dwelling fish would see."
"Started with solid colours - first blood red then dark red, changing to purple. Little green, very little yellow - only mustard. No orange. The pulsating small scale circular patterns of many kinds with a central focus. - 100 + cells. No large scale asymmetrical objects. Nothing that I can draw.
Perception of time shortened. "
My experience felt more different than ever. I felt like I was in a room by myself surrounded by these beautiful colours and sounds. The sounds made me feel relaxed and so calm. I let my body sink into the chair and allowed the colours to take me to different surroundings and places. The experience made me feel oblivious to my thoughts. Just as if I didn’t have any. I loved it so much. 
"I seen a person running towards and away from me in a yellow background. He was bright orange but anytime I went towards him he ran away? This was the majority of my experience.
A lot of yellow/orange/green and pinks.
Overall I really enjoyed and would definitely do it again!"
"Initially anxiety provoking but then very relaxing.
Wanted to sleep
Wanted to last longer
Peace of mind
Experiencing the light at the end of the tunnel
Blinking blue lights 
A lot of orange and blue colours."
"Mixture of geometric shapes
Soft shapes and flowing as if under the sea.
Glimpses of chains running in circular motion.
Flashes of hands reaching for something
Bursts of colour
A soft centre focus.
How you would imagine the surface of a planet/outer space."
"In the beginning it was an exciting visual of colours and patterns.
Then I fell into a dream.
A series of a succession of quick out of body experiences.
Sometimes I was watching
Sometimes I was the subject
But I wasn't dreaming. "
"Wonderful colours - clear, bright - red, blue, yellow, green - crisp!
Lots of repeated patterns
I felt warm when a lovely golden colour came - I would swear I was feeling the sunlight!"
"A kaleidoscope of colours, shapes, geometry’s movement, rotation, celestial + arctic shape patterns, a warm orange, yellow glow, a pink abstract form maroons + peaches, an eye near the end, maybe my mother? A turquoise jewel with red flashing a dark mist + pink gas cloud, a deep purple tree rising up. "
"Circular motion, blue ocean from underneath
Daffodil yellow to deep gold.
Deep purple. "
"Began with a sun-rise-y feeling.
At points I was very aware of flashing and intense light feeling made me feel a little like my head was getting sore.
I am aware that I had dream-like experiences in the middle, but now I cannot remember the detail. 
I enjoyed the dark parts. I saw navy/green darkness and it felt as if it was falling on top of me, that felt comforting and relaxing. "
I saw children playing together. They had died and were getting pulled to a place where every season was represented. I also saw two dogs playing and having lots of fun. Both the children and dogs were happy. 
"Started with colours like a kaleidoscope with geometric shapes moving in different colours fading to black with light strands moving.
A flashing picture of a bug flapping its wings very fast in the middle moving into lots of bees flying now changing into a spiral like a DNA strand moving around with colours moving in and out."
"Warm, like basking in the sun.
Fractal shapes of varying colours.
cool/hot mixed colours.
Sense of movement."
" see someone’s face blur.
Sometimes it fades away. Sometimes it’s just a contour. Sometimes it gets closer. But I don’t know who is that and I don’t know if that is a human being. "
"Geometric shapes repeating, swirling, radiating. Frequent backgrounds of cerise, then overlaid with pulsing blue shapes which gained borders of yellow, peach, orange, framing the straight lines. Sometimes a streak of bright yellow. At other times, with lower intensity lights I saw cracks + fissures of white and grey over lilac + green fine block patterns."
"Initially was like having a migraine ache (but not uncomfortable)
Lots of flashing lights. Myriad colours - warm yellow, pink on green, rolling shapes like I was travelling into a space.
The really bright light felt like being in the warm embrace of the sun.
When it was dark I saw swirling tendrils of dark green on a black - as if I was in a dark forest.
It was over too quickly! "
"Relaxing yet stimulating 
I enjoyed it very much."
I felt so relaxed so relaxed that I nodded off to sleep a number of times.
"Intense colours raging from geometric shapes of blue and white to full surround of bright orange.
Spinning throughout
Intense sensation of floating and eyes occasionally out of my control. "
I felt like I was in the universe. Maybe this was caused by my memory from the movie (science movie). 
"Bliss, acceleration, bliss, mild panic, bliss.
Time distortion - thought it was about 8 mins…"
"I felt very relaxed + think I wasn’t for away from sleep.
At first I seen a lot of greens and blues like waves I felt like I was underwater, in the sea.
I then seen lots of purple geometric shapes (can’t draw lol)
Then the wheel of the chakras, mostly the orange and yellow.
I wanna try it again. 
Thank you! "
"Bright vivid colours in small shapes/dots moving in different directions.
Geometric lines in monochrome flowing like an ocean in waves.
Flashing bright colours.
I did try to control the movement but wasn’t able to.
At one point I saw a starlit sky - moving around with myself at the centre point. It span quicker and quicker until all the stars became circles. "
Flying through the universe 
"Peaceful - relaxing
Feel very alert afterwards
Became aware of where holding tension in body during the experience + able to relax it. 
Early in the yellow light felt like rising out of body - floating
Wanted to move, vibrate with sound - releasing tension. 
Didn’t completely leave the world behind thoughts still came into head - mind still busy - while all was happening - split awareness? "
"Great escapism. Relaxing, distracting of the world around me. Very interesting experience."
"Hard to describe, dream-like in that it becomes harder to remember with each passing moment. Saw weird colours geometric shapes + organic ones with flashes of images of things I vaguely recognise but can’t remember. I felt a great sense of speed in various forms like falling and being pulled upwards and then flying. The sense of time was gone, seemed like 5 mins. "
"I had a voice in my head saying ‘life isn’t supposed to be hard - then I was zoomed away out from earth, seen all the planets and was sitting in the stars. This made me feel like the small things I worry about dont matter. I was then seeing all rows of traffic + was told “this isn’t the way life is supposed to be its supposed to be free."
I thought this experience was amazing! Really enjoyed it as I didn’t know what to expect before going in. I felt and seen myself fly amongst the clouds and also on a rollercoaster of colours. I seen stars and different shapes and colours. 
"Felt very relaxed most of the time - like being in space or underwater. When the music broke up a bit, felt more anxious + like being under attack. Interesting to reflect(?) just being in the moment or drifting off into more evolved thoughts. Also had a slight fear we were being mind-controlled. "
"I saw warm holes, sometimes it felt like i was moving through at hyperspeed than other times it felt like it was in reverse. 
I saw cells splitting, perhaps in a petri dish. I saw what looked like orange/solar radiation from a zoomed up image of the sun. I saw a red horizon through a dark backdrop. 
Kaleidoscope geometric shapes dancing through colours.
UFO, dish-like in shape, oscillating closer and more vibrantly. 
"
"Felt as though i was experiencing what is it to be born - the tunnel felt warm and safe and upon leaving there was a temporary discomfort which was quickly replaced with an overwhelming sense of anticipation at the potential of what lies beyond the tunnel.
Also had a lot of being under dappled water, felt like a fish looking up at what lay beyond the water!
Lots of ‘honeycomb’ moments, felt I was part of the honeycomb structure. Mad explosion of red - made me feel quite emotional.
"
"I had repeated sensations of being under canopy - far below the rood of a wood / forest and fast moving mottled orangey light. It felt safe.
At one point there was a subtle violet light that felt like I couldn’t quite see it - that if I opened my eyes there could be something in front of one. It didn’t build or take from it was more like an impression. 

I liked the energetic fast moving parts. I struggled to calm down / soften off at the end it when it became more soothing. 
"
"At the start, red's blue green shapes more rounded as the music increased in volume the colour became more red and the shapes became more angular, sharper. At times a series of round moving white circular shapes. "
"Lots of vivid colours, even the darks weren’t just black, they were blue, purple or turquoise. The brightest moments were like the sun, often started pink and then went to orange or yellow. Lots of flashing patterns, mostly geometric, sometimes words but I couldn’t read them. Sometimes it was like a projector spinning patterns, sometimes like the patterns were still and I was the one spinning. Sometimes many patterns on top of each other. I saw shadows or figures of people moving towards me but not straight on, like they were coming from my peripheral and then moving past me. A starry sky. The last section was very calming, like a ocean of satin sheet waves which kept changing colour. "
"At first I experienced a bright light turning to yellow and then intense ______
As the sound pulsated the patterns began in kaleidoscope fashion a bright primary colurs moving inwards and awards. Suddenly the colour changed from purple background to lime green ____ in regular pattern - circular. I think I fell asleep at time and “saw” figures - people a dog and a taste - No one I know! I felt very relaxed generally but I became aware of pain ache in my thigh and ginger which I rarely feel normally. Later on the brighter colour turned to more muted colours and at one point ___ and more still but then later exploded again to kaleidoscope. 
"
"Felt relaxed, far removed from the outside world. Saw a lot of blue and orange colours. A lot of boxes. Blue /orange/ white boxes. Space and the stars. Sunset colours. Skulls briefly. "
"Pixels and dots falling in space wide fields of colour, Red Yellow, Blue. Small high circles and ____ patterns like moroccan tiles. If I tried to focus on an image it would fade away quickly and I could stay focus. I needed to let it go to see what happened next. "
"Visual moving with physical movements whilst being conscious __ stationary state - a beautiful, relaxing contrast. Being in the likes of a _____ stimulation arcade - like lights, the tokyo of the mind and re runs of top of me pops. A joy to witness such engaging visual sequences, with such movement & multi-layered whilst not being overwhelmed. Pixels."
"Relaxing/ Comforting/ Warm 
Bright colours & felt heat like ____ in the sun. Really warm, sleeping. Dark felt colder; lots shapes dots like infinity at one point in a square room. Mostly in flashing light like a long corridor but never getting to the end. 
Love it. Would love to do it again felt really comforting. Sleepy. Worried i’d be the only one to fall asleep. Brilliant. 
"
"Coloured lights, in a particular pattern with a “___” at the middle. - coming in and out.
Relaxing enjoyable. It went in very quickly. Time seemed suspended and I now feel very calm and relaxed. 
I’m curious to what a regular series of this experience would result in - a posituve needs I believe.
"
"Oh, that astral blue that most ____ exist only in the cosmos. The appearance of the sun once, twice at the centre of the universe but always out of reach, never returning a 3rd time to take away to somewhere better."
"
At some point I felt I’m at very moment of the world being created. The moment of creatures of the whole universe, and moment of creation of myself. I felt like time no longer exist anymore.. Me and the universe were seated at the same time. There is no past, present, and future. Everything is circular. And the universe is limitless. Thank you. 
"
"
Lots of bright geometric patters, Kalaidescopic. Changing colours. Colours changed moving eyes left to right, sometimes more intense. Often 2 main colours eg red & blue (with some white) Didn’t see anything with the delicate music toward the end. 
"
Amazing experience. Immense joy and awe at the images. Almost too intense at times. Loved the colourful images but also the more fractal and pastel colours. At one point felt like my life was passing before my eyes - thought about death/during - how it is just a transition to a different phase. 
"
Lots of changing coluors shape like being inside a kaleidoscope. Some feelings of rushing forwards towards some point in the distance. Movement, beautiful intense colours - deep green turquoise neon pink intense mauve. I occasionally felt some momentary panic but stayed with the vision + let them come + go. I allowed myself to be with it all. 
"
"Combination of light, patterns, colours, music (type & intensity) brought me to different places I could associate with specific countries. I visited I thought Afghanistan for example. I suppose pictures created when reading books about this country were recalled. I never visited in my life. My emotion were fascination also; from sensitive, warm & longing. To ____ scary unpleasant. All this was connected to colours i saw & intensity of the music. "
I saw a cross in the middle a lot of fires. Maybe its time to follow my _____ faith. 
"At first I felt a force of drifting.
Enjoyed the bright light, warm feeling
Thought about my mum who passed three years ago , like I was on a journey with her
I saw lots of different colours, green, pink and yellow
Saw rabbits
Suction feeling 
Time passed very quickly, very relaxed
Thought about my kids, separately with different colours for each around their heads. 
"
"Lots of _______  - central point pulsing & kaleidoscope-like patterns swirling around it. Both clockwise and counterclockwise. Also felt like I was at the at the end of a corridor _ with the pulsing central point. ______________________________________
Lots of colours - mostly quite retro colours, but also blye, bright, and purple at points. I felt warmth, especially with the yellow/orange colours - like sun-bathing on hot days. 
"
"I had expectation of this experience. The breathing I found difficult at the start but I soon learned how to relax. I saw nature. Maple leaves in the autumn, dandelions blowing in the sky. Sometimes I saw terror, sometime calm. At times my mind wandered and I started thinking about the stresses in my life. I tried to shake these off but it was difficult despite all that was going on with this experience. Everyone should try it. I’m glad I did. I might come back and try a new way of interpreting this all. "
"Mostly crosses (X) and geometrical patterns. Orange, blue & green kaleidoscopic images. I wonder if the images of the flickering light somehow create a reflection of the capillaries present inside the eye and they help to generate the images. "
"I honestly cannot remember. At first I saw a different solid colour and then darkness and then a different colour and then I think I just want to sleep. 

I remember just thinking of everyday things I needed to do. 

I saw more dots and flashing colours in the initial trial. 
"
I was floating in a dream like trance - the light - pink and white was over powering. I have an eye condition and have to wear hard contact lenses. So I immersed myself in the sound scape. I was outside of myself like a cloud above the ground - feeling calm and gentle - it was ethereal. 
"
I found it interesting, I never went into deep meditation. The flashing light created amazing colours and patterns. I felt the flashing lights were a little ___ disturbing but not upsetting. I really enjoyed the slower lights and would have loved more gradual light.
Thank you 
"
"A colourful kaleidoscope 
Looked like I was spinning sometimes
Usually contrasting colours together or right after eachother 
It was like a very flashy kaleidoscope. Often spinning and changing colour to the music. At times it was all white with red circle everywhere. I felt more and more relaxed as the experience. Went on. 
"
"I was really looking forward to doing this for the 2nd time but I found it a bit disappointing. I tried to reassure myself that I would see whatever I needed to see & not put ___ under pressure. But there was lots of greys & reds and it all felt out of focus and I couldn;t focus on it anymore. I realised that I keep myself busy a lot of the time, and then when im quiet of still a sadness/emptiness comes up. I noticed it doing yoga recently but I thought it was just because I was tired. But I noticed it again today in the DM so I think I need to practice having more quiet, still time and get comfortable with that or try to see whats going on. It kind of feels like getting deflated, but I don’t feel bad now, just very relaxed. Lots of yawning. Think I started to drift off during the DM & saw a ___ or a cone of yarn rolling off a hill out of my vision. "
"First a sense of anticipation, making(?) the music to build in intensity. As it did so, there was a repeating ____ tone of 4 notes. My body was starting to tremble + vibrate with mains of energy, especially in the ___. I noticed that at the peak of the music my body wanted me to join in with the resonating sounds, like the sound of humming in meditation. 
Then as the ____ music fell like rain drops, my body gradually softened, no tension, nothing, just a sense of day ease + ‘being’ unthink thoughts or agenda. V beautiful - didn’t want to end. 
"
"At first I felt a little anxious - I have had some questionable experiences with hallucinogenics in my 20s and some of the intensity and how close the shapes felt to me in my field of vision triggered a little uneasiness from residual memory. But once I tapped into my breathing more and grounded myself by tapping my fingers onto my chest to remind myself that I am in my body and safe. After this short wave of overwhelm I really relaxed into the experience, finding at time that the combination of the music and the visuals ghost brought me to tears. What the human nervous system, mind and perception is capable of it immeasurable. 

I saw a lot of primary colours at the start and a lot of angled and cornered shapes - red, blue, yellows, and saturated, intense version of those colours. Shapes I saw ere diamonds mostly. I found that if I tried to focus on something this would be where I could feel the beginning of overwhelm set in, but once I softened my focus and allowed the experience to lead me then it became much more enjoyable. The light at the start - the calming yellow immediately brought a smile to my face and I felt a sense of warmth and as though I was somewhere safe.
"
"
The teaser sent me into a daze felt like I was spinning around the room. My head felt like it was knocking side to side in this moment there was happy emotion like burst of butterflies almost felt like I was on a roller-coster with blue ____ shooting through a circle. 
"
I just remember first stage - lots of lights flashing and shapes on white and orange colour. I can’t remember the second stage I feel like I was asleep.  Can’t remember! In my mind I saw some memories from my past (20 - 30 years ago) But I can’t explain what it was. Then I just like wake up 3 minutes before end of session but I don’t really know if I was asleep. 
"Initially saw lava spurting out and sliding down a hill. Deep red, then crimson then strong then to bright yellow sun, as if you were lying on the beach sunbathing half asleep. 

Kaleidoscopic, but mostly this feeling of being in a tunnel, travelling fast the lights skimming past as you drive through varying from yellow to red and blue.

Grey rain drops, as if you were under a sky-light watching this rain form onto the window.
Deep blue, fooling as if you were underwater getting deeping + deeper. 

A sensory experience like no other, not even dreams, I can remember calling being so vivid
"
It took a few minutes following the taster section to see colours. It then felt like a very fast kaleidoscope. Lots of vibrant colours and shapes out of focus. I eventually bored off. 
"A kaleidoscope of blues and greys or of reds and purples, swirling around and moving as I moved my eyes around, moving close and further away. Accompanied at time by fizzing sensation in my eyes. Then at other times a calm and relaxed feeling with bright full white light or a calm blue. "
"Vivid, beautiful shapes, flowing and moving in random direction. At times it felt like stars, the milky way and would stand still as a clear starry sky. 
At times it looked like water, with waves moving past a single point. Bright warmth that felt like standing in the sun on a hot day. Felt peaceful. 
"
Very relaxed. I closed my eyes but colours drifted through my consciousness - or was it unconsciousness? 
"Felt very relaxed & not aware of anyone else in the room. Was very enjoyable & relaxing at times actually fell asleep. Saw lots of colours, oranges, reds, yellow & felt like seeing spinning honeycomb or heart shapes, some shapes where like a frequency chart as if like reading when getting an ECG, but was never uncomfortable, towards end was very blue colour & felt like I was submerged in water but not in a scary way. Saw shapes at time like people, around table / small family size, lots of shapes like circles/ triangles / and kinda floating sensation/ very pleasant experience overall. "
"Lots of blue of varying darkness 
An eye
The universe & then the milky way
Dots in grids : red & blue
A bomb falling with a parachute attached
A mushroom cloud
I got lost in thought several times 
I felt relaxed but fully aware of my situation & my life.

Please excuse my french but this was the shit. Intense in a good way. Eurphoric, fun and relaxing. All at the same time. I attended the deep listening in te morning, prior to this ession. This was more interesting. The team behind this must know what they’re doing. 

I saw patterns that I would otherwise not see, imagine I also saw solid colours for biref moments but they rapidly turned into patterns. The patterns had various depths, layers, movements, dimensions. I saw vague numbers, figures, faces and letters but mostly patterns. I saw my favourite colours at times. This experience can be relaxing for those in palliative care. I wish there was a tech available to either record our perception in the DM or one almost dives into them, wants to grab or free some of those patterns.

"I was flooded with a beautiful orange light so bright I thought someone must have turned into the sun. Then incredible pattern/ colours pulsating kaleidoscopes, all charging, suddenly and relentlessly. Totally awe-inspiring and exhilarating. An incredible journey of colours and patterns, some shades I haven’t seen before. In particular, bright bright orange like a sun but with no pain an on incredible turquoise colour that was so vibrant and alive stunningly beautiful. I feel moved, honoured and at peace and all i can think is I need this at home! Thank you so much. Funnily enough I am reading DR __ book atm - fascinating to see it at work. "

Disco ball meets catherine weel meets sun rays meets more disco balls | oh and a littl ebit of reiki plus helicopter noise in surround sound when I lifted above my body. 

Starts with grey cubes into yellow, ochre, brown, with green lines, tracking like data (binary) in the disco scene. Then fading inro dark blue/teal turquoise sea with purple + green lime. 
"
"I saw faces, memories-still and moving images.
The geometric shapes often formed into shapes, re-occurring Lee I saw hearts collapsing in on themselves.
At times I felt uneasy when is familiar pattern suddenly change in shape or colour.
I was thinking about random things people have said to me throughout my life-And I remember the feelings I had at the time.
I thought about things I have been putting off and came to the conclusion about situations I felt previously conflicted about. At times it felt I was in a dream I would drop into the middle of conversations and not know how I got there. To summarise, this experience felt like when you kissed somebody drunk.
"
"A little nausea to start with. But only with the very first flashing lights. I felt a little pressure on my forehead and around my eyes, but it came and went. The pattern started immediately, as well as the colours. Lots of different patterns with tiny shapes, changing every time the frequency of the lights changed. Most of the time I’d say it looked like a kaleidoscope, being moved continuously. Sometimes there was a central focal point that then seem to expand towards the outside. At times that were like block/shadowy bubbles floating all around the periphery of the space. At times and this was my favourite, I saw loads of tiny squares with a……….
Whatever discomfort I felt at the beginning (nausea, pressure) completely went away at the end. Really interesting and wonderful."
"I found it hard to quieten my mind at first I began to sink into the 3-D sound world. As the music intensified, I went into full REM sleep. But not asleep. My eyes rolled around inside my head with great energy, almost too much. But I went with it. Then my eyelids began to open and close at quite a fast rate. This seemed to sync up with the tempo of the music. Colours dance and Flashed before my eyes, as the music became more calm after the first track, I felt extremely floaty, this sensation of heaviness in the chair and simultaneous floatiness was very enjoyable.
"
"I saw a sequence of different images that were on a cycle, each image came back into focus. Each image had a different effect on emotion. It brought back/focus previous lifetime memories and made me think about things I had completely forgotten about. Help me to focus on personal things I have been dealing with in previous meditation and yoga. This was overall a very positive experience – towards the end of the images that was on a cycle flashed in like a speed reel before a darkness followed by a white light. At the end I had a huge sense of relax and calmness. The music really help with the change of emotion."
"I’ve got an immediate sense of my soul coming into my body. The visuals allowed me to see and think of traumatic of experiences in my life without having any emotion or reaction. The main visuals for me were fractals and ever evolving geometry constantly flickering between blue/black, red/green and yellow and pink. Various seconds I also had the visual of flying through space being able to see stars and was even able to imagine flying through that together with someone I love. In the end when the lights and music both slowed down I felt an overwhelming sense of peace."
"Very like a kaleidoscope with overwhelming feelings of happy and wonder. Massive changes of colour and patterns of circles pyramids and eyes, with eyes always forming from different places. As the music got faster everything got more intense but still felt safe. I am calm and I am relaxed. "
"Like being inside a kaleidoscope, with an oval beam of light appearing in the middle of my vision."
Swirling propellers in fantastic colours like ‘...............’
"Lovely flashing colours - red, blue, yellow, sometimes overwhelming but also relaxing at times. Mostly blocks of colours with a ‘tunnel’ in the centre. "
I was travelling through a tunnel. Which was red and blue. Sometimes faces would appear through my journey and I could see a galaxy / blackhole at the other end. At one point I was attacked by what I thought were spiders. Then at the end of the journey it was pure bliss. 
"Lots of geometric shapes in lots of different colours. Intense white and yellows like sunshine.
Deep purple’s, blues and darkness.
Tunnels of light that sometimes felt far away and then more intense shapes closer to my eyes which were almost too much to bear. "
"Thought I felt like I was in a “sweet spot” between sleep and wake.
I perceived what looked/felt like Rosalind Franklin’s image of x-ray crystallography of DNA then about 5 seconds later a DNA helix. "
"New impossible colours don’t exist and transition and melt to become other new impossible colours
Moving geometric rhythmical complex patterns surrounded peripherally by Paisley organic forms.
Clouds at one point
Felt: Familiar"
Flashing colours - kaleidoscope effect movement - verging on travel sickness! One image of a mountain peaks in the distance - very vivid very bright colours and moving patterns
"A feeling as if I was inside my own head.
The start felt almost as if I was being born. Beeping machines and bright-lights. I couldn’t tell if my eyes were closed or open anymore.
A fantastic experience.
Felt as though I was tripping on acid or mushrooms, but different - no worries about anything - forgot about life. Definitely like a psychedelic experience. "
A kaleidoscope of various colours + patterns shimmering and bouncing with the music. As if (at times) colours + shapes were on top of a loudspeaker. Dancing in symmetrical patterns. Colourful tunnel type effects. Beautiful feeling.
"Kaleidoscope of colours and shapes/explosion of colour + shape.
Mostly red/orange - dominant colours.
Is this vision similar to death?! Dying? Journey to the “above”.
Outer space?
Illusion of flying upwards through a tunnel."
Thought it was quite restful though I liked the lights + colours it was amazing that it was in so much colour. 
"A small fiery hole disappearing constantly.
Framed by a flame like shadow.
With misty clouds drifting past. 
Very relaxing."
In a rocket/vessel going forward in slight gradient sound of propellers (helicopter?) eventually at a standstill with propeller stopping.
"See: A hospital room, brilliant sun, waves
Think: My past, how my perceptions influence what I see + feel
Feel: in general, peace, but that peace came with many things, including death, but not in a bad way."
"I felt relaxed, immersed in a bubble of bass guitar. Lost in my own dream and back to reality once music turned deep strong ‘.....’. Nice experience!"
I saw lots of green circles. Which increased in size. I had images of the sea and the waves. Also a helicopter coming closer and then taking off into the distance. There was laughter + people.
I saw an eye pink in the centre looking at me with shapes around it. Also a black bat floating to the left. I also saw a bird floating to the right black. 
"I felt I was lying in the warm sun, headphones on listening to a meditation track. It took me back to one of the nice things about lock-down. Transcending the day to day into peaceful sound and motion. "
"Lots of colours - red yellow oranges - red park blue - pastel colours - when music quieter/ less energetic / very relaxing - complete black when music most still

Wording! - twice !! - in very distance - block 3d letters - black -yellow surround “summertime” !!
Lots of stars initially - but totally evenly spaced - perfect geometrical

Aurora - when relaxed between pastel colours +blackness (nice relaxing blackness)
But not aurora aurora - no floating - waves - more geometric & just for ten seconds.
"
"Peaceful. Happy for the most part. Changes in emotion. Found myself smiling at one stage. Felt as if my muscles were totally frozen, as if I couldn’t have even moved them even if I wanted to. The “helicopter” sound was very powerful, like breaking through a barrier but in no way frightening or scary. Rather something to be welcomed. "
"A beautiful journey through space + time. I met future life forms who connected with me on an quantum level. Initially they permeated my brain with love and an awareness of the infinite possibilities of life, they had a deep desire to heal and support. Then they sent love and joy to the whole world. I was surrounded by a joint awareness + connection. Then every cell of my brain + body became radiant + whole. At the end they left but their love + joy remind in me and their presence will always be with me."
"A plane crash, in slow motion the part above the clouds, sort of freefall before really gathering momentum so, we’re all going to die but no one knows it yet, I can hear them _____ and shuffling peacefully and smell their feet. "
"Peace - a journey into ___ depth - some deep sadness that was intimate & tender & beautiful - some presence of a being that was like me essense of myself btut unbound - a presence of deep kindness with me - a sense of deep rest & relaxation - inspirational images & idea that related to my own creative process & ways to express this in movement, installation & colour. The shared experience of art as in-spirit-in inspirational as best art can inspire or induce. At the end feeling like we need this kind of sound healing in prisons, schools, hospitals, airports, public spaces - places of healing. Thank you."
"Peaceful
Emotional - had tears in my eyes (emtional release)
Hopeful + @ peace
"
"Very hypnotic + relaxing at the end. I feel like I had a sleep. It might encourage me to take up meditation 
An unusual experience 
"
"Kaleidoscope visuals aside 
I had a pre-dream that I was telling a story
About a time period where I had lived as a pencil  but instead of a rubber on the end it has an afro head of hair. 
"
"An explosion of shapes, mixed with light; as if I was hurling through a tunnel "
"I was like a magic eye puzzle in my head. Really different and unusual, but very enjoyable experience for the sense. "
"
Underwater kaleidoscope with hexagons and butterflies. The centre looked like a supernova star explosion and it felt like I was travelling through outer space. 
"
"Light was very relaxing and after I saw many flashing patterns, some shapes which normally I never see. They was pulsing and get in close and for far. I feeling like inside of rainbow or inside the sky at night because I saw white stars in black sky but also many other colours time to time. "
"Initially I struggled to keep focus, thinking about the experience of entering the dream machine, the apprehension of what the experience would be. But once I relaxed into it I seen a bright  pink background with a bright colourful spider web/mandela like pattern. Two black and & white spirals either side. I could see a black figure to my left when I tried to redirect my focus to it. I heard my mother and grandmother let me know I am doing them proud and to keep on the same path which then showed me a pink pathway and white dots. Overall a very relaxing experience showing what our mind can reveal and how creative we can truly are without always realising."
"Initially yellow and warm orange with worm like small ___
Then around edges snowflake like fractals which are in black white and grey and tuquoise and honey comb shapes breaking up the orange and yellow. In the centre. Sometimes lines of contrasting colour going horizontally by then in fractals in 2 crontrasting colours - red green or blue and purple occasionally getting closer & further. I felt calm and deep relaxation.
"
"Similar experience to seeing shapes in clouds. At the start I felt that I was seeing insects, animals and city scapes. After realising I was assigning these shapes I saw less articulate shapes and more reverberation. I was experiencing the music and “lights” as one. The drawing I completed afterward shows this. "
"Cascading colours and an almost _____- colour scape with moving microscopic flashes of colour, like the inner workings of a cell. 
Shapes were fairly geometric I straight lines and right angles at times and others it seemed to all slip into a discord of light.
"
"
Pleasant, felt floating and moving through space flashing yellow amongst concentric waves of red, blue and black. I did see figures of humans which I believe where the pepole sitting oppsotie of me. Tired in a well rested way. P.s excellent music very immersive.
"
The experience was an intense visual beautiful vivid of bright colours shapes and feelings. 
"It was extremely intense - I saw lots of geometric shapes, very sharp lines and angles. There were layers and layer, with some shapes/figure whirling around. I felt emotional - like the experience reached inside me and made me grow deep inside. It was neither happy nor sad, just intense. I lost sense of the time + place+ felt quite anxious at times. "
So many direct colours & shapes - sometimes discernible & sometimes not. Started feeling like I was travelling to another galaxy then entered a kaleidoscope (trippy!!!) then felt like I was on a bullet train watching the world go by. So many shapes and colours! Favourite was the warm yellow / orange light that made me feel like I was sitting in the sunshine.

"At first, with the blue lights on, I mostly thought about my late dad and felt that he was peaceful. We both love blue. I mostly felt peaceful, throughout the whole experience, with a few expectations. When it was purple, I had very rapid thoughts and quickly changing emotions. I went through the experience with both my eyes closed and open at times. I was expecting to see more visuals when my eyes were closed. But did not. When the light was orange, I thought about global warming and I closed my eyes. Saw _____ like raining clouds. Near the end, I noticed two dark spots, on the light screen and wondered if they were flies or bugs but I guess they were screws to fix the blind curtains."
"
Rhythmic beats - I wanted to dance to them 
Calmness, warmth 
Then warnings - people trying to tell me things I needed to watch out for
I felt I was only just shedding expectations and a sense of waiting and hadn’t fully got past the everyday - this is what it feels like just before falling asleep.
I was hoping for something ___, but there wasn’t anything like that

(PS I dont think black  paper is the right drawing background  because I couldn’t see black)
"
"A lot of flashing hexagons, slow flash into fast flash. Starting with one colour and ending in another. Sharp lines in a shape of a cross all light headline into the centre. Beams of circular light _____ from the periphery of my vision. At points it seemed like I seen stars in a blue background. "
"It was euphoric + sometimes overwhelming
I imagined a woman playing a cello at the door of a green villa , almost like a semi-dream.
I had a sense of falling through time and space, not in a scary way but as part of a beautiful journey.
"
"I seen lots of jaggy edged shapes that morphed from shape to shape, colours blending and disappearing. When there was sudden flashing I seen many flashing waves and when there was darkness, small white dots appeared and I felt like I was zooming through space really fast, my eyes got runny as well. I feel slightly emotional. "
Colour moving in tandem with each other. Mirror image of the other kaleidoscope feeling. 
"Transition from a heartbeat, a rollercoaster, underwater and many more scenes. It was a powerful feeling of relaxation and calm. The music brought a sense of travel and movement. It felt safe, even a more dramatic moments, colours changed through scenes from blue to green to orange to red to grey, "
"I could see at time the outer parts, becoming like a waterfall effect, only backwards. My chalk sketch does not do this experience justice. So many viewings to try and pick one; hard to put pen to paper. A lot of shapes, some in clusters or shrinking/enlarging. 
Great time guys!
"
"Mostly orange & reds & reminded me of kaleidoscope. Felt very clam & tingly sensation on my face, specifically my nose. Also felt like I was sinking into my seat."
"Reminded me of a child’s kaleidoscope. Burst of sound white and yellow light that morphed into patterns of honeycomb, grids and spirals layered onto each other. _____ tunnel or grid of light pattern sensation of floating, drifting + falling "
"
I thought a lot about childhood and my mum. I felt safe. I saw squares of different colours, lots of childlike primary colours that danced around. At the beginning I felt the intensity of the music relaxed, it then felt safe. I left the danger behind and draped in, I suppose. I dropped into th stars and the universe and felt enveloped. I had tingling in my arms and legs, then could feel my heart beat and the left side of my body beating really hard. I could feel the other people in the room. This is where my comfort came from the collective experience- stars and childhood.

"Relaxed, like a massage for the brain.. Fantastic experience !! Towards the end it was almost fully submerged."
"I was aware of a resistance to ‘dive in’ to the experience + im not sure why. I could see trippy shapes but couldn’t detach myself from it being flashing lights. The experience was deeply meditative + pleasant, especially the part at the end. "
"I loved the experience! At the start it made me feel like I was passing over from this life into the next. (Almost what I hope it may be like when the time comes!!)
I saw colours that reminded me of being a young child. Deep, deep rich purples. Magenta’s, warm ochres and ____ patterns. Almost carnival like. Fractals, movement, warming, colours, comfort peace & joy. Magic x

WTF even was that. How can you ever draw it.

Love! Really warming experience where light patterns ______ my thinking and made everything feel positive. Really enjoyable. 
Intense physical journey. Epic well with it. Thank you for the experience. Truly magical.

What a fantastic opportunity to experience “wonders”, this should be part of everyone's daily experience. A very safe environment and a lovely out of body experience. 
"
"Very relaxing throughout even the louder parts. Strange how with eyes closed it was so vividly colourful. At one point, very black but when opened eyes, room was light. Country side colours - green.
Seaside - blues
Black with jellyfish - like blue/green shape
V short period of those & mostly gentle & calming just
Felt cold air / our body warm once or twice.
"
"I felt total happiness at what I was seeing even though I had no understanding of it. I had a massive smile on my face; the some smile I get when im enjoying watching live music or my favourite film. It took away my anxiety by allowing me to explore concepts that would normally be frightening because they are unknown to me, and by rewarding my stillness with beautiful images. At times, I felt moved almost to tears. I could have kept on for hours."
"Extremely calming - swirls of blue, purples and yellow. The journey of light & colour was comforting. 
"
"Entered with feeling of nervous anticipation. Felt that I might experience an emotional release before the session began. Appreciated the guided breathwork intro to enter into a different headspace. The experience felt safe + encompassing, like coming home, sense I have had other similar experiences through breathwork classes + other ceremonies etc. I have a busy mind and get distracted easily. So i preferred louder music and strobe to fully pull me into the experience. At times I was guided by my own thoughts, at other times I just tried to observe the visuals and sensations.  Visuals were immediate + unavailable, pulsating patterns, spirals, a blue core, shimmering hands. Thanks to all involved for providing this experience in safe + comfortable environment."
"I saw lots of geometric shapes the first time around. 
tried to concentrate on breaking but was being knocked out of it somehow.
Felt like travel through space sometimes 
Sometimes felt like a dream
"
"
I saw geometric shapes, tessellating together, sometimes pulsating. I saw colours-mostly oranges + yellow shapes. shapes , bubbles, faded + pulsated on top of the orange. The music was hypnotic. I heard fragments of conversation that means nothing I feel rested + content. 
"
"Continuos spirals and tubular shapes changing colour, red + pinks mostly spinning cogs getting faster."
"
As someone with ADHD it is really hard to switch my brain off. Sometimes lights + sounds can be really overwhelming but this deep listening experience was fun. I felt immersed into the world of my own dreams. At times I thought I felt the sun on my face, at others I could hear myself on a helicopter flying over the ocean. I could have stayed in there for ages. 
"
"I was sailing on the water, a great ocean, but without actually being on the boat. There was a huge ship just behind me. I was pointing towards the future, wearing a huge explorers hat. I travelled through the world with ease, like a stream. It was really uplifting + beautiful + it was the calmest I have felt in some a long time. I dont know how to recreate this feeling but I know in time, I will get there. It felt like freedom."
"I felt that if I let go completely my experience would be overtaken + overrun with everlasting images + feelings from a phobia and even more so averse to the idea my brain could or would of its own volition, allow this to happen
"
Every now and again I kept seeing a female Budha. I also kept seeing an eye. Then things would change to really intense geometric shapes and to a more relaxed groovy Austin Powers ___
Chaos.
In the beginning there were images like a human eye or a busy street but as the process went on it was completely flashing and flickering shape.s 
"Fractals, geometric shapes, buzzing in the brain, feeling of warmth in chest & head, tension, releasing out of the eyeballs."

Triangles and honeycomb
Spinning sensations
Deep blues and oranges
The feeling of needing to close my eyes while they were closed

I saw a filter + a drag queen among the lights + colours 
Falling into different dimensions. 
"Bright red/orange, hot, with sand dunes in the distance 
Mountain tops covered in snow
Green squares 
At times uncomfortable

I seen much more visual images in the sample session at the start. There was lots shapes, hexagons, rectangles. Almost made up pieces of architecture. I preferred the lighter sensory session. I previously took part in. I felt tension at time between the eyes 
"
"
I wasn’t sure if I was awake or asleep. It was a 3 dimensional experience, at time it felt like travelling through a tunnel, at other times it was like being in a void or another dimension. The shapes and motor colour of pattern seemed to have an infinite variety.

An eye predictability in centre of a dark background surrounded by purple. The blue lines seemed to move in an arrow formation towards the centre of the eye. There was a sense of movement towards the centre of the disembodied eye. At one stage I felt as though there figures moving towards me from either side who moved away as the lights faded from view.
"Initially I felt anxious + panicked - I thought - “Today in the day I find out I am sensitive to flashing lights”
Then my body began to relax before my mind 
The following was relentless and did not let up - Mainly red, orange + purple. 
And eventually it became yellow.
I felt more relaxed as the time passed.

"At one point, I felt like I was back in my mother’s womb and I could hear her heartbeat, it was in rhythm with my own. This experience was deeply powerful, moving and comforting I felt safe and protected. The overall experience was uplifting and a deep connection to myself, it’s beautiful. "
"I felt free & thought and _____ immersed in the music and patterns of light . my whole body felt deeply at rest, blended with sound, light and my own breath - beautiful "
An immersive experience that was a lot more in depth than the listening experience previously attended. Colours which reacted to the simulation of sound and light. Thoroughly enjoyable with every colour imaginable aside from white. 
At some stages it felt like both my eyeballs were shattered disco balls vibrating inside my head. Almost like my head was drowning in TV static/whitenoise. 
Showered by colours and shapes with a feeling of euphoric purposeful emotion. Warming and calming at times. Stars/Squares. A healthy trip - thank you.
"Colourful lights, sometimes they would flash, sometimes, they would spin. Various shapes and identities. I felt like I could see my brain and all the synapses. Kaleidoscope dancing in my eyes. "
"A prominent white, bold circle in the middle with flower like shapes either side. ."

Like I was floating in empty space or swimming underwater. It felt like I couldn't feel where I was or what was around me, just a sense of stillness and calm.

"Floaty but in control. Everything appeared to be going at a frantic pace yet at a snails pace all at the same time. Intense but calming, pretty trippy stuff like. Felt like being watched(?) at times or at least feeling you go when you think you’re being watched. Enjoyed a lot, mind, would recommend "
"Initially felt very anxious & panicked palpitations, claustrophobia but after a few minutes it disappeared completely & was totally beautiful & became calming. "
This was my second experience. It felt a lot faster this time around with everything moving more quickly. I focused on the music more this time which I found deeply relaxing and grounding. 
Driving down in dark round at night watching the lights of the cars in front & also sometimes being on a beach or in a rotating tunnel 
Light Kalidscope 
It felt like a death and rebirth and also like I was looking at infinity

"Shapes got more clear as time went on when felt like in actual dream 
Lots of patterns and colours mainly red & blue

I didn’t like the orange colours and felt the music at that time quite intimidating. Relaxed again when it changed to purple. Loved when it was completely dark - relaxing
"
"Initially, just yellow - orange-ish warm colours. When the rhythm starts, complex geometric patterns appear - at first black and white, circular patterns like a circular chess board. Then, when the frequency increases, blue and red patterns appear in the centre while the periphery remains complex black-and-white patterns. I feel like I was in a tunnel, like the one seen in sci-fi for space jumping or black hole. I feel a bit floating. When the light is off. I still see dark green or dark blue colours, as if I were in a deep ocean."
"When the music was slow I saw yellow like when you are seeing directly to the sun. I realised the light was flashing when it started to see like a massive amount of stars in white, red and green. Once the music started to turn down again + saw a small blue circle in the centre. "
"I mainly saw geometric patterns, rotating or pulsing. The colours were very vivid and rich and I saw a variety from crimson and dark teal to orange, again, even beige! Some grey and mauve I was surprised to see tessellated star shapes (5-pointed I think) and pentagons. I didn’t want it to end."
"I lost my sense of time and of finite space.
I was lost but not concerned
I had some flash-backs
Was very dream-like but with no story
A deep sense of calm
I wasn’t sure afterwards whether I had been asleep or not"
"An ocean of orange, red spinning round in a circle getting closer and closer before giving way to blue spots and green galaxies. Pink flashes and lines in a kaleidoscope kept giving way before returning to the orange desert and blue sea. It felt like a journey to somewhere not yet seen, but also very familiar in places - peaceful and scary, but always here."
"I saw lights and shapes that looked like from a kaleidoscope. The shapes were very symmetrical and had different colours but followed a pattern.
I saw a human shape with light all around it (white). Some blue sparkles came out and were all around this “person”. I have no idea who this “person” was. "
"I imagined rebirth, life + love colliding. Sinking into a dream.
Quiet moments in between, people, spaces, places.
A collection of meaning, the inbetweens, brief + that hold time together. Lovers embrace, putting laundry on the line, the breeze, laughter at work + kind words of acquaintances.
Life + colour, that slips between memory.
A merging of the in between. Of holding + seeing oneself in a dream. "
"Saw
Striking, deep intense colours. Streaking away. Overlapping canvas of colours, shapes and movements, with new colours, and shapes bubbling through from underneath as the streaks of colour criss-crossed indefinitely. Being interrupted occasionally with a large solid, dominant force from a colour, which was once again overwhelmed by the rest. Never overbearing for long.

Thought
Mundane, unexciting, disinteresting thoughts, things so uninteresting they’re unimportant. With an awareness they were being thought. And a consciousness that they didn’t matter. But a calm satisfaction they had wandered through."
"Lots of round globes and many faster and faster until they became lines and tunnels. Mostly a warm pink colour but blue crept in from the sides. And took over every now and then. Prism colours on the edges of black columns. There always looked like there was a slower, moving pattern wandering around in the background, as quicker, brighter globes flashed faster in the forefront. "
"Generally patterns of lights starting from dark black, dark blue, green, then orange and bright yellow. Then started to dance and circle around. Then saw bright door or could be shape of person far away. All different rainbow liquids where around that shape. Then saw lights like fireworks all over. "
"Lots of blues + reds + burnt orange.
For a second the night sky filled with stars
An eye in the centre with lights swirling around into the centre as if it was getting further away, like losing a memory and trying to grasp it but seeing it disappear.
Silhouettes, outlines, to the bottom right, like people 
Travelling into the centre
Geometric shapes
Tv static 
When the light got brighter it felt like lying on a beach + the sun rising, I almost felt the heat on my face."
"Rapidly mutating geometric shapes in brilliant reds and blues.
Kaleidoscope fracturing shapes.
Lines that drew me into a tunnel at a thousand miles an hour and then suddenly reversed and I was shooting out of the tunnel. 
Sense of moving through space, between the stars.
Always something I couldn’t quite make out on the periphery - one time it looked like crowds of people.
The propulsive music was fab. I was a bit concerned when it hit its noisy breakdown.
OVER TOO SOON! A little longer and I think I’d have had an out of body experience.
Loved it. "
"Every conceivable geometric form, hurtling at unimaginable speed toward a central, focal point of intense light and complete darkness simultaneously.
Brief flashes of memory, too quick to fully recall, more like flashes of emotion (?), than concrete events.
Felt my synapses were being prodded and activated by some mad, god, scientist, child.
Not unpleasant. "

Quite relaxed afterwards

Upsetting."
"Pulsating geometric patterns rising and falling in intensity, with sudden surges
Very much in synchrony with the pulsing rhythm of the music. "
"I saw many crosses, red and yellow, zooming in, constantly. When the lights went off. I saw bubbles green and blue. "
"Honeycomb of white
Warm orange glow
Nostalgia
Psychedelic disco of youth
Geometric red and blue"
"At the beginning I could see figures dancing with blue, yellow, orange and red colours. Then I could hear the sound but I don’t remember seeing anything anymore. It was as if my mind was bland for a long time until the experience assistant came into the room."
"Vast spaces of darkness like travelling through space and time, dawn breaking with light coming through tall trees the music changed the feel and calmness I felt. 
Was less intense when I put mask directly on my forehead. "
"A lot of squares
orange/white vast light
Letters - almost like signs.
The beach
My body felt as though it was heavy. At one point I didn’t think I could move my right hand. My hands felt very warm but my feet felt very cold. "
"Started with very stony colours + intense movement. Then I really enjoyed the black spaces - it felt like I was in space.
Really cool experience. Feel very relaxed and tingly. At the really intense music + lights I felt my body viscerally. Loved it. Thank you. 
Space Matrix "
The most pleasant experience was ‘seeing’ the dark blue light which recalled space with the dim glow of stars. My thoughts ranged from seeing family past and present which was a warming experience. 
"I felt warm, bathed in light, and happy.
colours , many colours, unbelievable."
"Travelling through time and space 
Retinal patterns
Immersed in sunlight
Waterfall
Rain on windscreen
No mans sky"
"I felt relaxed, but not happy. 
I didn’t like what I saw.
I found all the red quite distressing.
Also didn’t like the repetitiveness of the pattern. I found it quite difficult to keep my eyes closed. I had a tendency to want to open them up."
"Amazement, then anxiety - had to conquer fight/flight or control reaction.
At one point, a sense of being in a large dome=shaped space.
Mostly red or pink colours. Reticulated - the pattern was usually centred and radial.
Sometimes snow-like/dust of white dots. "
Totally all encompassing sensory experience. Otherworldly. 
"Water flowing
Going through tunnels very fast. Travelling through time.
Sunlight like day break. New day.
Didn’t like fast flickers liked it when it slowed down, became very relaxing + therapeutic."
"Peace
Tranquility
Joy
Love
Care for others
No worry"
"A kaleidoscope on speed
Intense fragmented colour
No images - disappointingly 
I’m told to return!"
"Relaxing
Bright lights
Shapes - squares triangles 
Colours - vivid"
"Watching a dreamscape whilst relaxing on a beach.
Different visual shapes. "
"Relaxing exhilarating when moving images.
Kaleidoscopic images interspersed with relaxing golden water reflection like light - very relaxing. "
"Deep sense of relaxation
I could spend hours here!"
?
"Intense colours
Merging shapes
Changing tempos
Flickering
Circles
Block colours occasionally 
The brightest white light"
"Kaleidoscope colours
Circles 
Triangles
Diamonds
A bird on a branch

Travelling through time on a spaceship
Stopping suddenly at different points of past + future."
"Did not think I would relax but strangely it was very peaceful. 
Quite emotional at times which I find inexplicable.
Beautiful experiences floating in the cosmos. "
"Fishing nets of colour which would catch thoughts, allow me to have a closer look at them then release them back into space..
Very intense initially then I reached a point of complete comfort. I’m much more calm leaving than when I went in. "
"Started with a blue light, fractal shapes appeared felt like a rebirthing experience. "
I zoned out.
A little bit alarmed at first by the end a bit ‘spacey’!
"A lot of red + black, confused why I saw a lot of red + black. I saw a lot of grids and straight lines. When the music slowed down I saw blankets of different colours like yellows and oranges. "
"Squares, triangles travelling at very high speed through space I felt I was moving and my mind began to lose control it began to feel uncomfortable and I became very hot. I had to leave. "
I loved it. Perhaps think about 2 mins of silence at the end?
"I felt like I was passing through time and space a thousand miles an hour. The galaxy hurtling past.
Letting go!
Fractals of every shape and colour.
Lots and lots of red.
Like I was on a journey
Felt calmness after experience. "
"Embodied, multi dimensional. An oscillation with depth of field, vivid colours that break down into fractal geometric fields.
Resonating at a visceral level, akin to DMT or Psilocybin.
Moments when my mind would come in try to make sense this would fade within the pause of the breath. "
"Clear skies, cliff edge, crashing waves, animals, dark figures.
Blue skies, blue birds.
Bright hole, with flashing lights. Sharp bright lines that got thicker and thicker."
"I was in the “in-between” phase - heading towards sleep, my body getting heavy but I’m still conscious. It’s dreamlike but I still have some control. You want to hold on but also let go. "
"Like being asleep while awake, being able to shape my own dreams and thoughts in a semi-conscious relaxed way. A deeply relaxing experience where all that existed was the moment and I was totally present.
A hypnotic experience. "
"I saw every shape known, colour and every shade of it. Patterns moved in all different directions simultaneously and all fit correctly.
Sometimes I could control the colour, and the shape and sometimes I couldn’t.
I felt I was moving through space and time and it was eternal.  "
"I saw everything and nothing. Transcendent. What is life? What is the meaning of anything?
Are we all seeing the same thing?"
"Bizarre considering it was only white light.
At times it felt a little too intense and I had some pretty long lasting strobes behind my eyes. 
Great experience and incredible how different people saw vastly different things. "
"Happy warm orange glows of burgundy.
Peace, safety, happy feeling.
Moving down a tunnel and being pulled back over and over again.
Simple peaceful space lost in time. "
Panic!
"I saw-
Red maple leaves coming towards me
Green mountain topos
Blue dots/stars
A silhouette of 2 people playing the drums
A lioness face
The surface of the moon
I thought i could see into heaven
I enjoyed the sensations after the first few minutes."
"Deep peacefulness
Total relaxation
Dream state
Out of body feeling
I didn’t want it to end. "
"At times filled with light throughout my body.
Dark blue and speckles of turquoise being cradled space, travelling the universe.
Cracked earth in dried up river birds.
Frantic patterns honeycomb shapes."
"Loved it, saw the boots logo loads."
"Constant light was pleasant and dreamlike
Birds appeared in many different forms
Geometric patterns emerged frequently
It became a little uncomfortable as the flashing quickened. "
"Sorry! I’m lost for words. Just loved the experience. Very beautiful.
(Thank you!)"
"I gradually calm down after I close my ears, all from the frustration from the beginning. The colours are mixing, circling and separating, and again. 
In the whole chaos I saw a boy’s face, he is just looking at me with his blue eyes. His skin colour is pure I haven’t seen him before. But I just tried to look at him for longer time. 
This is the last thing I remember before I fell asleep."
"That was immensely groovy, man!
Shapes and colours, kaleidoscopes and forests and floaty, man!"
"Sometimes loose swirling natural curvy shapes.
Sometimes hard geometric diamonds emanating from the centre, spinning and swirling.
Sometimes just golden background with fine lines, sometimes curved, sometimes straight.
Every colour under the sun.
orange , blue, light blue, dark blue, red, blue, yellow."
"I sensed movement.
I found it difficult to relax as I find that difficult to do when I don’t know what’s coming.
I’d like to experience this again now I know what to expect and would then be able to relax more and become more involved in a deeper experience. Who knows what I'd feel. "
"Almost see my pupil in the middle of each sequence of colours.
A lot of vibrant colours rolling and flashing. Followed by some very muted colours and deep colours.
A lot of red/burgundy.
Felt giggly at times and had to use my breath to control the giggles.
My body felt heavy.
A lot of geometric shapes. Had thoughts of wallpaper!"
"Endless geometric patterns.
Changing colours.
Calm."
"I saw multiple staircases leading upwards to a warm sun. I could feel the sunshine on my skin. It was warm and welcoming. I felt peaceful. The stairs were beckoning me to rise upwards. I could feel my body rising up, especially my hands and fingers I felt free to move onwards to try something new."
"At first I felt so anxious, then suddenly overcome with an indescribable overwhelming feeling - a positive feeling.
I saw a purple colour I have never seen before.
Streaks of magenta!
Then an encapsulating jelly of amber.
A peachy cloud carrying me away.
Floating away from the cloud - I could not stop the tears."
Very Sigur Ross meets Jeca Michel Jare via the academy of sound through the medium of 3d surround sound! A very zen sense of “No Mind!”. Brought me back to my meditation training for Wu Shu!
"Vivid pink and orange waves enveloped me. I was in a sky of pink and orange, dreaming.
The music changed direction much more dense and dark, strong and I saw lots of dark, strong and I saw lots of dark green and dark blue. I wondered if I was deep down in the ocean?
I enjoyed the change it was intense. 
I enjoyed the heavier music.
Then I saw sunrises and deserts and golden sands. Which was joyous. I felt free, safe and happy.
Thank you! "
"I knew I was in a low place but I didn’t realise just how much. This experience took me to a low, dark place but then gave me hope and with the lights and music it made me think things aren’t so bad and I have come through a lot and can come through what it is I am going through now and will see a nice happy light again. Thank you for making me see I am strong."
"Relaxed
On point it sleep
But still conscious breathing
A blue moon, if you will.
Lovely meditative music.
Although relaxed I still felt RSI pain
Struggle to fully surrender thoroughly 
Always distracted by anxious rumblings. "
"At first I was scared I was going to lose myself, like I had no power. It was terrifying. Then once I remembered it was just my own eyes, I felt safe. That I could let go.
I went to two significant memories, where I’d felt like I couldn’t trust myself. It felt confusing. Then I felt the colours and patterns pull me out. There is beauty in all chaos if you can forgive yourself.
Then I floated upwards into a deep blue, like night sky reflected in water.
And I felt calm. I’m going to be okay."
"A dragon
buildings/place from around the world - Taj Mahal/New York
A deer/skull/snakes
Diamonds
Hearts 
The feeling of being under water 
A beach on a hot day
A casino/Queen of hearts/Alice in Wonderland"
"A lovely relaxing experience in the middle of festival madness.
Dawn this morning was very beautiful and found myself thinking though the lighting colours were lovely, nothing compares to nature."
"Taken by Aliens
But
Friendly ones
Who played good music."
"The line between life and death.
Connections with nature, the world, the universe.
Giving birth."
"I saw colours coming and going’ sometimes clearly distinguished, but mostly not, the sensations reminded me of the Beatles song ‘Across the Universe’ - flowing, caressing, coming and going. 
A somatic/resonating/meditative experience; a sense of being suspended in something other-worldly.
Thank you! "
"I definitely found it easy to “zero out” more when the lighting + flashes + vibrations were more intense, I think that it was meant to be relaxing during the more mellow parts but I personally found it hard to let go during these parts. Towards the end I did start to relax and I think was even on the verge of falling asleep which is when I started seeing more physical forms rather than just patterns. "
"Soft orange into intense Red, Blue and red cones swirling and rotating, grey + white sparkles turning into insane 80’s socks pink + yellow halftones pattern. A black + white cityscape like something from eurotechno but with a cyan and red sky. 
Lots of movement, no cohesion, need 8 or 10 more hours in the chamber."
"Incredible!
Session was over in a flash! The taster felt much longer than the actual session - so I was very surprised to hear that the taster was 5 minutes and the session 25 minutes…!

Very restful and relaxing.

Saw lots of moving small shapes, mostly orange.

Interestingly, I felt like I was looking/could see the shapes much better through my RIGHT eye…?"
"I had a very vivid experience with multi-colour shapes + rainbows appearing. It felt as if I was on a rollercoaster going through space at times. Very relaxing throughout.
At one point I seen a lot of cubes of different sizes + colour it was like being in a living painting - have never seen anything like it before.
When it seemed I was on the multi-colour roller-coaster tracks I felt like it kept speeding up until it flung me off the end of the tracks into a large open multi-colour space. "
"The colours and patterns were both gently flowing and intensely all encompassing. It was like travelling through time in Doctor Who, or a spatial anomaly in 2001: A Space Odyssey.
The steady tailing away was like the ending of a piece of music - and the sun setting. And then a new dawn would begin again.
It was like a messy explosion of light - both beautiful and exciting. "
"I was here this afternoon for the sensory. I was much more visual earlier. For the deep listening I just felt very relaxed, eyes open mostly enjoying the coloured lights changing and the music, could easily have fallen asleep. I definitely want to come back again and experience with again and see what I see next time. 
Thank you"
"Fantastic experience of intense, vivid lights, patterns, shapes, movement, images. A wonderful experience though difficult to try and explain/verbalise. I would definitely like to try this again and will recommend to as many people as possible. It was quite overwhelming but wonderful. "
"Very colourful, like a kaleidoscope. Like I was travelling forward and backwards through like space tunnels.
Had sensation of things going in slow motion or freeze-frame.
Towards the end felt like I entered a large circular space (other worldly) like another planet/space."
"I seen a portal or eye that I kept moving towards in a vast tunnel of every colour imaginable. Until towards the end the eye or point of travel became a woman (I think!) in a green dress. All together a wonderful, magical, peaceful experience. Thank you."
"I came expecting sensory overload. Instead, I was brought into a state of trance. That led me to completely fall asleep.
The lights and shapes that appeared before passing out was extremely interesting.
By the time I woke up, it felt like a really short experience. "
"Being you - Anil Seth
Seven and half lessons on the brain
Deep, intense, space, rain and water.
I felt movement and jaggedness. To breathe through.
Felt like I was travelling through different spaces + shapes/prisms. Rain. saw colours; red, purple, blue and green."
"I had a great experience at the Dreamchine. Although at first I wasn’t sure, I suffer from mild anxiety and I’m prone to panic and anxiety attacks, and so experiments that I’m not familiar with can be triggering. It was no surprise that I was afraid at the start, but I’m learning to let go and so I did and it made the experience a lot more enjoyable. "
"Abstract patterns + colours faces in the distance red and green strobing mandalas that felt a bit threatening. Astronomical pictures galaxies nebulae.
Biologicals eg. cells, cell walls as if looking through microscope purple veins against a dark background - very calming. "
"Very relaxed, but had a desire to open my eyes. It felt a little like the visualisation you often see in films where someone is moving through space, time, dimensions.
Any attempt I made to see something/a shape more cleanly resulted in the blurring, disappearance of the shape. "
"There was a darker circle in the middle. The circles around the middle circle where rotating around the middle and moving in towards the centre.
One experience was were clown were moving in a circle before my eyes. I was able to control. The movement from side to side and up and down."
"Felt: Focused, relaxed
Thought: Some memories came back, some current surrounding/situations
See: Shapes - geometrical mostly. But complex forms two, like fireflies in dark, fluorescent wingy things flying. Circles, spirals, checkerboards, concave and convex shapes
Say: THANK YOU DREAMACHINE!"
"I felt very relaxed; the voice of the girl was the starting point. When the lights began, my scalp went goosebumps and at certain points I felt asleep, I know it because I woke up while the lights were still on. I wish it lasted more! I loved the experience! Congrats!"
"I saw light patterns moving in different directions, at times with a seeming split between top and bottom with a varying pattern of interference where they meet, soaring arcs intersecting at times with regularity to the pattern and at other times moving randomly and punctuating out from a particular point. Mosaic-life patterns with perfect regularity slowly dissipating; and mostly red, yellow, white and blue colours. "
"Similar to an attempt at meditation the mind get distracted.
Changing from lightness to darkness
The colours I saw when my eyes closed were different to the colour in the room when I briefly opened my eyes.
I felt sleepy
It made relax and de-stress
I imagined this is what a baby might see in the womb?"
"2nd time here. Very similar experience, lots of vibrant reds and blues maybe even more this time."
"Colours shapes patterns
People faces landscapes
Maps script on a silver dish"
I felt very emotional and had years a lot. 
"Relaxing
Anticipation
Wonderment "
"A period of relaxation
Multiple colour/shapes"
An immersive kaleidoscope of the most vibrant colours. The colours were from a heavenly palette with shades and hues I have never witnessed before
Kaleidoscope on speed.
Very relaxing but intense experience. I had to put the eye mask on about half way through. Very enjoyable though. 
"Warm, transcendental, like riding on brain waves that dripped honey."
"I had fleeting moments of different ideas or moments from present or past - nothing particularly specific kind a sense of having already experienced it.
At times I could feel warmth on my face from the light."
"Landscapes of open fields
Seascapes
Skies of green stars
Vast oceans of birds wings opening and flapping
Pulses of pure energy
Spheres of intense light
Faces + conversations of people I recognise
Castles made of crystals + glass"
"Peaceful   Movement    Swaying
Intense     Morphing      Pulsing
Colours     Patterns       Patterns 

Felt peaceful and intense in equal measure
Colour + patterns never seen before."
"THE SOURCE OF ALL BEING
PURE
ENERGY"
"Complete relaxation 
Euphoria
Taken to a different place
Happy - context"
"A lot of peach and like
Globes, almost space like - dystopian - solar systems
Openness
Relaxing
Blue, aqua
Daytime "
"Death will be ok.
It’ll be okay."
"Relaxed      stimulated
Happy         euphoric
Creative      fractals of the mind.

          DMT
          For 
          Free. "
"Felt like my eyes were open throughout - seeing a range of colours esp red, green, purple trees, water, piers, child’s face, two adults. "
"Epic
Travelling through space
I’ll be back"
"Small in the expanse of the experience
Unbalanced, as if the whole room could have tilted by 45 degrees. "
"Rainbow 
Flash
Patterns
Shape
Colours
Inside out or outside in."
"At times really overwhelming and almost uncomfortable.
The range of colours and shapes that I saw was incredible though!"
"It was sharing a dream with others, a kinetic experience - almost physical.
Beautiful and mystical. "
"Experience in this order.
Bright orange + yellow colours - like a sunset/sunrise
Followed by swirling patterns, feelings of travelling very fast in a tunnel all in grayscale.
Deep colours of red + magenta
Bright orange + yellows like the start of the experience
Deep purple colour
Image of stars/space
Amazed! "
"Very relaxing but still able to focus and be submerged in the experience
Very comfortable and the space was exactly what I needed to let go and lean in
The music paired so well with the lights in terms of intensity.
It felt like a journey.
It felt safe.
I feel like it is an experience that will stay with me. "
"Spinning shapes, 3d patterns.
Diamonds into recursive shapes.
Flying through a starfield."
"Started looking into the sun and then travelling through clouds in a thunderstorm.
Was like being in a kaleidoscope and being able to see with closed eyes. "
"I felt calm + released following the experience, zoned out + tired. "
"Beautiful colours - vivid, changing, (brighter).
Kaleidoscopic combinations red/purple and yellow/purple. (Gentle)
Initially colours had background dark lines + squiggles - scattered. "
"Lots of kaleidoscope shapes.
Lots of reds, pinks, orange.
Blue shapes - rhombus + hexagons - light + dark blue.
Long lines of rainbow colours waved across - like flowing.
Beautiful colours - felt like colours I haven’t seen before. "
Like a spinning cog - turning into another spinning cog - Bright Lights and dark metal split equally between each indent of the cog - kept expanding and turning into a bigger + brighter one - felt like it was endlessly expanding but still recognisable as the thing - I don’t know lol. Amazing.
"I felt frightened at times and wanted to pull back. It reminded me of past times on acid.
I felt euphoric also and hopeful for the future. It made me want to seek peace in my life. 
I felt drawn into something bigger which made me think of my mum who is passed.
My body felt alert and had pent up energy at my back. "
"Towards the end felt I was falling headlong down into the deep sea but it was very welcoming.
At times felt inside an embryo.
Breaking out of a city of very tall towers through to the edge of the clouds.
Felt as if my eyeballs were dancing behind my eyelids at first until they relaxed.
My head moved around trying to follow/find the answer even though there was no question.
Above all very relaxing and life affirming experience. Light + colour and a sense of belonging."
"Sun rising at the very dawn of creation, the wonder of creation then being dropped into the black mass of the galaxy, this was a wondrous place to be in the wonderful dark of space."
"Host of it was patterns but at one point I saw 2 lime green horses running - one behind the other with a black background.
I loved the experience - very relaxing. I would have preferred my feet + legs being raised."
"Lots and lots of varying colour in pulsation
Flickering mostly fast.
Desire to move my body
Dance freely
A bit of anxiety breathing helps
Slight pressure on head
Swathes of colour
Diamond shapes
Geometric at times
Raising of consciousness perhaps more so if longer experience.
Pulsing beats (pleasurable)
Body wished to interpret sensations perhaps!
Sense that the other dimension is brightly coloured."
"Very surreal, thoroughly enjoyed my experience at times. I felt I was travelling at warp speed and other times motionless, I loved the visions of floating in water with sun rays, the orange water and then the bottle green. So many geometric shapes and how I know what it feels like to be inside a kaleidoscope. "
"As someone who likes to be in control, it was a fight to allow myself to just let go. I found myself thinking of opening my eyes as I could not believe how I was visualising the shapes and colours in a dark room with white light? I felt as though I was in a kaleidoscope - I strangely found such peace in the absolute chaos of what I was seeing. "
"Very relaxed, thought lots of thoughts that I’ve had during the day. Not one thing in particular just seemed like lots of thoughts passing through."
"Drifting in and out of awareness, asleep yet awake
Pulsing rhythms of a heartbeat beneath my spine
Luminous coloured kaleidoscopes of circles encapsulated by an alien landscape
Blinking brings new washes of watercolour petals floating, drifting across my plane of black expanse."
"I saw different colours and shapes. At some times I felt I was in space, in a dark blue space with a white net with irregular star shape forms.
At the end I felt inside a yellow space with a big spherical yellow form that wanted to communicate with me.
I felt very happy. "
"Mostly deep colours - Purple, Green, Orange.
Face of an African man with patterns around
Occasionally geometric shapes but mostly relaxed random blobs - cloud-like, floating.
I think fell asleep twice with pre-sleep dreams - can’t remember of what but did know at the time.
On a few occasions had to stop following my thoughts in and to switch off.
Very relaxing. "
"The music reminds me of ambient music my friend ‘......’ used to make - he died in February - the music helped me feel close to him and relive happy memories. Remembering things he used to do and say. I transcended the reality I was in and I felt happy and peaceful. I felt like we were together again.
Whatever feelings we may be repressing came to the fore. "
"I must be too sensitive to bright lights! I felt like I was in the worst club in the world with the worst strobe lights in the world.
2 very brief moments where I was in a space + felt like something was about to happen, then my eyes were burning, so I had to stop."
"That was the most surreal experience I have ever seen. From white light I just seen loads of colours, shapes. It was like being trapped in a kaleidoscope!
Towards the end I seen a bean like shape in a circle surrounded by what felt like liquid, maybe something in the womb. I also kept seeing a five prong shape over and over but not a star.
Kept thinking about time and nearly drifting off! 
Very interesting.
Thank you."
"Peaceful, relaxing, floating through the universe seeing every colour and shape imaginable, saw all images, my brain could imagine, pyramids, eyes, mountainous scenery, stars, galaxy’s.
The big thing was the kaleidoscope for me."
"The deepest experience was during a yellows, orange phase. The patterns seemed like honeycomb with sun pouring in. I’m a beekeeper, and I felt like a worker bee whose hive has been opened, light shining golden. Then it went dark - ah, the beekeeper has closed the hive again! Then I was out, flying through a haze of colours and shapes, seeking flowers for pollen and nectar. Very enjoyable experience!"
I had a feeling of witnessing a city’s destruction. There were building shapes to the side and a lot of explosive action in the centre… There was an arch about 7 of them inside a passage. There were also trees to the side the building and trees were VAGUS grey shapes. Also there was a tornado at one time. At the end you came through to calm. 
My experience was very good. I was able to let go and fully enjoy myself. I would do this again and would bring along more people to enjoy this. The only thing I would change was it was a little cold. I was able to dream or and calm place. I was able to fully let go. I would like to thank all the staff for an amazing experience. 
"Enveloped in an underwater paradise of forms, fractals, sea creatures, floating in an endless sea of changing light and shapes.
Magical + magnificent!
In my element. "
"I felt overwhelming peace and tranquillity. The green dots felt like it was the matrix, then atoms, then space. 
The blue was like a sun and I felt its warmth. I also saw yellow lines moving across quickly. And briefly saw ‘ghost faces’ moving out of vision after spotting them. "
"Exhilarating, relaxing, multi-dimensional, multicoloured, sensory in sound. Mind + Body, overall feeling of peace, swimming through an ocean of sound + light, feeling washed by waves. Of ‘......’ joy + light + colours."
"So so relaxed, felt the heat of the sun, the warmth on my body.
I was aware of being there but not there totally.
The ending: felt like I was crashing back into my body. Like my body was calling me back, me crashing back to reality. I felt gutted that it was coming to an end. 
The sparkling colours were so vibrant. Nearly always I could see an ‘eye’ like shape in the centre like a dragon eye."
Vivid orange that turned into concentric rotating patterns of different shades of pink/red/blue/purple. Then neon green old yellow lines against a black background. 
"Mainly orange circles and bright lights.
Some black + white movements
Turquoise and light green circles
Circles fading in and out
Wonderful experience - thank you.
Felt the need to smile a lot
Felt body sensations like pins + needles but in a nice comforting way. "
"Waves of light, dark, movement.
Geometric shapes, squares, circles, pulsating and morphing into each other.
Colour fading in and out in moving panels
Contrast of sound, shadow, depth.
The light drew me upwards and beyond enclosed me in warmth and inclusiveness
I felt comforted, cocooned, safe."
"A lot of deep sunrise orange. Circles with hexagon shapes and diamonds flashing red flashing circles like going into a tunnel surrounded with blackness. Only seeing the flashing circles, kaleidoscope effect with even flashes and shapes, intense response physically as eyes twitched and body jumped a few times.
All over great experience, thank you. "
"Beautiful colours - vivid, changing, (brighter), kaleidoscopic combinations red/purple and yellow/purple. (gentle)
Initially colours had background dark lines + squiggles - scattered. "
"Hands reaching someone dancing
Lots of colours like a kaleidoscope
Relaxing sometimes other times intense
Smiling + content
Greens + purple were the most relaxing colours. "
Relaxed like I was falling through the ‘......’ or space. 
"Beautiful sky blue light slightly off middle of central vision. I saw an embryo, a tiger eye, stars and diamonds. "
"Very vivid colours and changing patterns similar to a kaleidoscope.
Felt relaxing - could have stayed longer
The beginning felt like a beautiful sunrise - like an awakening."
Kaleidoscope -?
"God 
‘......’
Being given BOTH to 
Dying
Ghosts."
"I had to leave as soon as the experience started
I felt a strong pain in the centre of my forehead after experiencing a strong white light followed by swirling coloured lights. "
Full pastel colours making way to interlaced diamonds surrounded. By a central sun/star like dot. This would flip between a tunnel-like movement like a travelling very fast almost like warp speed or hyperspace from star wars. Occasionally saw hexagons or spirals slowly rotating. Parts of the music caused an oscilloscope type band moving in time to the music. When lights went out all colour DISAPPEARED into a shrinking white dot in the centre followed by APPEARANCE or blue or green mist until lights started again. 
"Stars and swirls
Deep blue oceans 
Lots of blue and white
Purple skies"
"I was trying to relax and I think I got there.
I saw a few rooms that I recognised, in red and blue and white, like a hallway I had visited before maybe in a dream I enjoyed falling into the lights and colours.
I was seeing the micro universe like I leant into seeing the primordial creation of the universe - how interesting!"
Felt like I was in a club with lots of different lights. Seen a lot of blue and red when the lights were flashing and making different shapes. Saw orange and yellow when was solid colours and purple before it went dark. A lot of shapes and movement. 
"Amazing, bright colours focused around a star in the middle.
Black.
Loved it!
Thank you so so much"
"During the teaser/intro I saw patterns dancing and spirals of rainbow colour. When the trial ended and we began breathing work for the full thing, I have no memory or recollection for me, the people guiding the event left, then after a few seconds come back in, but I have not feeling or recollection of sleeping it's like my mind just blanked it all out. "
"I really enjoyed the experience. Setting of old church really enhanced the experience. I totally lost track of time in the Dream Machine
Thank you!"
"Felt very comfortable
Like it was a familiar space and I had been there before.
Lots of blues and reds
With a mix of yellow.
Lots of vantage point imagery - feeling almost like trains were passing me by.
Large red eye - like images enlarging and moving closer
A very pleasant experience."

"I felt like I saw myself in a craft around the edges. The lights were beautiful and made me feel a sense of ease. Towards the end I started to become introspective and question recent events in my life. Similar to a mushroom trip, it felt like it put me in a similar space. Not too the same intensity but in the same realm. I feel a sense of lightness afterwards. Thanks. "
"Feeling very dreamlike, still relaxed. I had eyes opened and eyes closed throughout. The colours I saw behind my eyes were not the colours when I opened them. I saw green and deep indigo blue when there was pink lighting. Little trails of luminous lights."

Such an eye of intensity occasionally in midst of the pattering. A little girl in ____ clothes who would come from the right hand side, approach but never cross my vision fully. Like messengers they were. Emotional experience at time when my mind wasn’t being blown by the colour and patterns.

"Entered with feeling of nervous anticipation. Felt that I might experience an emotional release before the session began. Appreciated the guided breathwork intro ro enter into a different headspace. The experience felt safe + encompassing, like coming home, since I have had other similar experiences through breathwork classes + other ceremonies. I have a busy mind and got distracted easily. So I preferred the louder music and strobes to fully pull me into the experience. At time I was guided by my own thoughts, at other times I just tried to observe the visuals and sensations. Visuals were immediate + unavoidable pulsating patterns, spirals, a blue core shimmering hands. Thanks to all individual for providing a unique experience in a safe and comfortable environment.

"Patterns of colours I had never seen before. Strobes movements that changed speed & rhythm. Viens & balls of colour. The orange, the most ‘orange’ I had ever witnessed. Like seeing the inner workings of my mind. When the light went dark there was almost always green veins. With light came shades of yellow, peach, orange close to red. There were dull blues & browns & purples mixed in the more blurry shapes. Prisms in multi-pastels. It reminded me of looking through kaleidoscopes as a child. I began to close off near the end, it was more difficult to focus. "
"Many shapes and colours - initially yellow/blue hexagon shapes (a bit like honeycomb). As the ____ progressed, colours seemed to switch to blues, greens, reds throughout.

"Like being inside of a kaleidoscope that was moving very fast. I couldn’t control it. Sometimes it felt like a figure was going to come into focus but it didn’t quite come into focus.

Stressed :( 
"I saw a lot of vortex type of shapes, in many different colours. Crazy patterns with the odd familiar shape breaking through. I was conscious of the interaction of the music and shapes. A few very dark squid like creatures (no eyes of creatures more shadows) springing around.

I felt relaxed, drifting off on a journey of my own. Lots of different coloured lights and shapes. It was like going to sleep and then someone turned on the light. I saw some shapes too and some made a picture in my mind. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience but would’ve liked it to last longer

I felt relaxed, it felt surreal and highly enjoyable, I seen colour red, green, pink, blue. White orange, I seen an eye with the galaxy around it, it was beautiful!! I saw lots of different shapes the most frequent being the hive shape and what I can only describe as the droplets of a firework.

Felt totally relaxed - seen lots of colours + shapes. At the end thought I was floating in a forest with fog/smoke rising. Didn’t feel scared - felt totally at ease + so relaxed.

Relaxing. Probably drifted off at one stage kept feeling I was at the beach or seaside. Waiting to hear the seagulls. Then the big lorry drove round and brought me back. Now have a sorehead.
"I felt relaxed enjoyed the music and the space. I meditated almost to sleeping so was starting to dream a bit but it ended too soon. I saw mostly floating, morphing shapes. My only complaint is that the curtains leave gaps where lights come in when it should have been total darkness. "
At first I felt I was floating up to heaven and was very peaceful in my mind of the end. I also experienced new beginnings new life in nature and also in human life. I got quite frightened when there was red light and louder music as it made me feel/ think about death / dying and going to an eternal hell. But was brought back to a nice feeling again with pastel lights. I found the bright lights very intense and this gave me a sore head. 
"
The experience went by extremely quickly. It felt like around 10 minutes. There were lots of colours & shapes. Lots of reds and blues. No real distant shapes and no ability to concentrate as things passed your mind & eyes so quickly.

"Past, present and future - made me think that most stresses in life, are no worth stressing about!

Time to relax and focus on my breathing, which left me feeling very zen.

"Started with opaque blacks of colour, then after the flashing lights happened I seen hypnotic colourful patterns. Many different shapes + constantly changing patterns. There was always a focal / starting point in the middle of the pattern. Shapes of colour took on different forms + melted with each other a purple / blue colour was constant. "
"The faster flashing brought on a feeling of euphoria, a sensation of being incredibly relaxed, but also of connection as though I could access any part of my brain, any memory, any sensation I had ever had. "

I felt anxious at times as my mind kept on worrying and thinking and moving. By the end I felt drowsy and very physically comfortable. I kept on thinking how I was somehow falling out the experience by worrying about life a deep calm came too and I didn’t want it to end. I felt warm and then very cold when I left.
"Saw mostly single flat colour at any one time. Sharpe lime line as outlines for a brief time something like a grey eye, of an older man. I feel quite conscious the whole time, not going deep/ Dayto day thought only, superficial/ some residual relaxation "
"Colours penetrate my eyelids at various labels of intensity. Sometimes the more gentle light created a sense of cleansing impurities throughout the subconscious mind and body. It felt like the faster and more chaotic light patterns were transitions. It was as if within each transition, stagnant energy was being shaken and released. "
"
Started with bright light like the sun. Then for most part flashing colours molouts moving like a kaleidoscope. Purple red - the mixture of kaleidoscope and clouds. Near the end was like travelling through space then like lying on ground looking up then like under water looking at stars. Bright light again then galaxies.

Mostly red and strange colours. _____ the bright intense light and then blue/green olours as lights faded. Lots of patterns like chess boards and club pattern from pack of cards in red and black. Felt a bit anxious when patterns seem to be “coming at me”  the music was quite intense then too to add to the experience.

"Brought me back to childhood memories - I could see things and remember textures and patterns (sofa, chairs) that I hadn’t thought of in years. Flicked through periods of my life. I saw my children, sunlight, beaches it was all incredibly moving. "
"I felt like my brain super nova’d into a massive kaleidoscope and very colourful blackhole. Repeatedly. 
"
When I was a child I used to press my eyelids to generate colours and I had forgotten that I used to do that until today. There was conflict in my experience. At times I smiled widely involuntarily but other times it felt too intense. I had to pull my mask twice. It was very orange and red with slithers of blue slicing through. I really appreciated the moments of darkness. Such relief! I am so glad that I had the experience but I am not sure that I enjoyed it as such.
"I felt like I was a shooting star blazing through space. Passing different planets/galaxies. I saw lots of changing geometric shapes and sequences. Similar to a kaleidoscope. 
It felt hectic at times really peaceful and still other. It felt like the light was on me, inside me, drawing me in. my arms were tingling in points. Felt overwhelming at points, think I was forgetting to breathe and felt panicked. But I reminded myself to breathe and not panic and was able to slow my breathe and relax again."
"Total immersion.
I felt calmed + comforted.
I didn’t want it to end; it was proper peace.
After all the crazy shapes finished I felt like I was travelling in space. 
Other-wordly.
I loved the bright orange colour-euphoric fractiles(?), repetitive shapes + colours.
Very trippy, the nicest possible way.
Blissed out.
Feeling of relief even happiness while heading towards death."
"Space, limitation space. Colours and shards, moving, fading, swirling, diminishing. Clouds of colours, dissipating. Sparks leaping, joining, flowing up, dying away.
Total immersion. Occasionally a desire to close my eyes, but ‘they’re closed!’.
Relaxation, even guidance, gratitude and joy.
Thank you. "
"I felt a sensation of absolute calm. Surrounded with peace. The inside world seemed to slip away.
My body felt totally relaxed, all the stress seems to melt away.
I am not sure if I fell asleep but I remember one minute being in the space but then the next being outside in a field. "
"I could feel the music pulsing through my body.
At times I almost felt sick but it wasn’t completely unpleasant, just an awareness of my stomach moving. My body was extremely heavy, my limbs felt weighed down by an invisible force.
I had my eyes closed most of the time, I felt like I connected more that way, the sense of relaxation was complete and almost trancelike."
"Listening to others speak about how they wished the program was longer, the realisation that we don’t spend enough time stopping to quiet the noise in our heads.
So much static to cut through, it takes us longer to ‘tune in’ to the sound of our own breathing."
Blue skies and meadows.
"I felt my body become light, light as a feather, that was drawn upwards towards the stars by the vibrations of the music then returned back down into myself I felt my emotions where all interlinked swirling around in space, insignificant yet powerful. "

I started to feel very relaxed from the start in the waiting area.
Overall fantastic experience, even the drawing afterwards, I could’ve happily stayed for longer."
"Hard to put into words. Once fully relaxed it felt like I was floating in a space full of colour and flashing lights. Was like being on acid/LSD without actually doing drugs.
I felt like I was sinking into the seat. Would have been nice lying down. "
Fractal symmetrical swirling 
"Felt like I was giving my mind a holiday from itself.
Time travelling with just your mind.
Fantastic colours. "
Vivid colours + fractal patterns. Geometric shapes and spirals.

The wonder of light.
"Started just all red
Then moved to light blue pulses coming out of black hexagons
Sometimes felt like moving very quickly, the light and shapes moving past me
Then shapes made from lines of pulsing colour cylinders and circles. The shapes moved and transformed into different shapes.
Sometimes a spiral circle of colour: pink, orange and blue. 
Then sometimes pulsing red checkerboard of light."
"Trigonometric patterns
Spirals
Sometimes people - old memories but I don’t know them 
Felt like my hand was on backwards
Different planets
Stars
Letters and numbers mainly ‘S’, ‘5’, ‘N’
Spaceships with certain music and stars wars like guns
Slenderman appeared
The light was going around me. "
It was like a dance upon the cosmic waves!
"Initially, lots of interlocking hexagons, in yellow and red.
Washes of bright white light. Followed by sudden comforting darkness.
The mind wandered to things I want to do but haven’t - the bucket list.
Wondered about the science of it - the way in which the eyelid is only a partial curtain, and the brain does its own thing with the signals.
Brought back to the body ‘...................’ in my head. "
"Smooth changes between constantly changing patterns pulsating and vibrating. A range of colours of deeper and stronger hues.
The darkness between these sensations was profoundly dark. An inky purple dark that put me in mind of death, what the experience of death must be like. But the sensation wasn’t scary, more reassuring."
"Excited and thrilling during the experience, moments of pure joy, but whilst feeling safe + calm. I felt like my eyes were open the whole time and I was floating in a room full of patterns. Maybe like flying through space. Felt queasy at one point. Like I was spinning.
Afterwards, I had a rush of overwhelming emotion and couldn’t stop crying. There’s a feeling of grief and sadness I can’t explain."
"Intense closeness of sparkling flying oscillating colour blanketing my inner consciousness.
Feelings of joy + happiness, wonder + adventure, exploration. How I imagine being born or dying!
Diverse patterns changing from focal points to peripheral vision. A tiny squeeze of the eyelids completely transformed the complexion of the visual patterns - from intense swirling colours to black + white into lightning strikes + back again.
Deeply relaxing but simultaneously stimulating- always changing.
The brain is amazing!
Very psychedelic. "
"The whole experience was very relaxing and cathartic. I went on this beautiful and intense journey which I did not want to leave. I saw lots of fascinating colours and shapes. Sometimes the different backgrounds merged together. 
I saw colours collapse into a collective point while floating through space, blues like the ocean, a yellowy colour with blue wisps which was like being on the surface of the sun or in a desert, twisted arch and multiple bright colours + flashing, bright colours turning into a square type shape in the middle and more.
In short, it was a pure bliss, magic and delightful journey. I loved where my mind took me while being in the Dream Machine."

"I want to go back “there”
Whenever it is. Or wherever.
It feels like a meditation
And leads to similar state at the end -
Losing oneself in… not being, not individual anymore.
Amazing. Experience, it’s impossible to describe it. Colours, dimensions, movement, all combined with music was spectacular.
I feel awe and miss the experience already, i want to go back “there”."
"It was very intense. I found tears in my eyes almost immediately, and early on it was quite terrifying. But it is also a release - I even laughed at one point. The haze that was left, floating after a long period of flickers, was utterly beautiful.
We hold so much inside ourselves. It is a wonderful space for sharing an individual experience with strangers.
If only we could all experience a dreamachine every now and then, surely our world would become a more flowing place.
Thank you. "
"Everytime I experience the dream machine, everything becomes more detailed, not just colours and shapes, but new detailed graphics. A castle where a painting of a man and woman come to life and kiss and then sink back into the painting. Beautifully detailed castle walls with flowers and leaves, but more CGI looking. I fell asleep at some point and a snore woke me up and I felt like I couldn’t tell the difference between my awake and asleep. I tried to remember everything but can’t. People were there but not sure if i was dreaming (merge between awake and asleep). So much more detail in this third experience.
I remember something from the high sensory, my favourite video game came to life and I was in it (castle related). Lots of castle themes. "
"Very relaxed (needed my ankles raised for full comfort please)
I did not hear the instructions at all well -
Background music too loud for the speaker.
I just heard the sounds.
No visuals effects.
No strong emotion or thoughts
I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to have my eyes closed or open? So I did both from time to time.
Lovely colours on the domed ceiling
The warm colours pleased me the most.
Thank you for the experience + for me to participate.
Good luck with your project."
"6th experience in 2 days
I feel like my mind is making pictures of what I’ve been seeing lately. The 3 experiences I’ve had today have all been focused on castles. This time I saw people working this job outside in Edinburgh, morphing castles, then back to people outside doing this job.
Each time I go through this experience, my mind sees everything more clean and realistic. First experience was morphing shapes and colours and now everything is either CGI looking to very realistic people. (Like a dream, but more clean…) I am amazed and am so excited for the future implementing this fascinating, science, art, technology, music, frequency, light, sound, relaxation, etc!!!!!!"
"Just a few colours and shapes, not much, it was quite dark and peaceful.
Like way out in the darkness of space. With a few starbursts. Here + There. Mainly purple, violet. Burst. "
Waves in and out of consciousness. Thinking deeply of real life experiences + of people I met or of being in a plane. Specific memory of flying to Sri Lanka. Felt my tiredness. Shapes danced in front of my eyes. Imagined colours but could not tell if these were the same colours projected into the room or if I was making them up. Flashes of light too. A reflective space.
"I wish I hadn’t had an americano just before the experience. It prevented my body from picking up the beat, getting into the zone. It makes me wonder how many experiences in the real world I am missing out on by drinking endless cups of coffee throughout the day.
It is amazing that this usually soulless space of the Edinburgh Ice rink can be transformed entirely and so successfully.
At some point, when the sound increased and the beat sped up I felt like being underneath the rotating blades of a helicopter - in a war zone.
An amazing experience. No wonder people are coming back so many times. "
"Deeply relaxed
I could feel the whole of my body, heavy against the seat.
Peaceful!
Sometimes (2 times) I realised I had ‘gone somewhere’... noticed when I came back.
I have MS - and my ‘MS6g’ twitched, irregularly, in the later half of the session (audio session)"
"I felt like I was being carried away to outer space, even though there were loud sounds, at times it felt completely silent, alone. Peaceful and frightening at the same time. It also made me feel like I was observing myself, as in an outer body experience, where I was afraid and happy. "
"Timeless, joy, one. Particularly when my heartbeat beat at the same time as the light + sound.

Slightly anxious at the beginning and very relaxed by the end.

I only wish it could have been longer as it felt like that just started. I had no idea how long it was.

I loved it!"
"It felt like going to space, like in a film - but not the technical side, more the emotional and spiritual side. Like going on a journey and then coming home but without really going anywhere. The feeling of movement but not physical movement, spiritual movement."
"It was like going somewhere and constantly arriving somewhere in my mind. Like timeless travel I wanna be in. 
Thank you. "
"At the beginning of the main experience I was seeing the sky and the clouds as if from a plane, into ‘.......’, with sunsets and sunrises, clouds and pure in colour. I saw landscapes; it felt as if I was flying. At some points I fell asleep; it seemed as if I immersed myself in the light; my mind was flying into it, ‘......’ ‘.....’ to some of the very different thoughts I had, which I can’t recall in detail now. I didn’t want to wake up. It seemed releasing and ‘.......’ at the same time.
I saw different ‘......’ ahead of me made of light; white and static, colourful and flowy.
Thank you."

Awareness of breath expanding

Astounded at the colour and variety of shape
Organic + square, all the things all at once.

"Calm, lost sense of time (it felt like 10 minutes). A sense of travelling, I felt like I was on a journey through space. Started thinking about David Bowie and his wife on an alien world, making love. A feeling of wellbeing."
I felt like I was on a timeless journey with no beginning or end. 
Warmth
"Space openness light floating
A little unnerving at times - aware of being in control but also not in control transported. New experience 
relaxed."
"Nervous at first
Once I knew it was going to be okay I relaxed into the experience.
My mind travelled to events of the day, but i felt extremely relaxed; at times bordering on sleep. 
There was often a sense of circular movement within a “tunnel”. Once or twice this movement changed direction or pulsed.
I wanted the experience to last longer because it was very pleasant.
Also the colours I saw were often in patterns and contrasting, e.g purple + yellow or blue + brown. "

"Started out with a bright red light, which eventually turned blue. Saw some spinning blue dots and then a blue/green cross-hatch pattern which looked like some sort of light interference pattern. "
"Like a kaleidoscope - lots of colours, moving in and out. Hypnotising. Dreamlike. Time passed very quickly."
"Smooth, soft, circular clouds, with light and colours peeking through from behind. Edgeless space and sight. A tartan sunset of blues and reds.
Toward the end of the experience. I saw bows and arrows made from bright white electricity. I saw my puppy, Mabel, and maybe I dreamt, possibly falling asleep. "
To breathe is to experience the full flow of life. “Freeze” leads to stuckness. Breathe fully and feel all of it flow through you - Release and let it go. 
Three blue suns being taken into a black hole while the black hole is spraying out some sort of rays in red colour. 
"Waves of waves
Streaking from within
Constant dance of life surrounds
Busy thoughts shooting stars, everywhere.
The journey continues"
"Deeply relaxing, intense, time disappeared and didn’t matter for the duration of the experience. 
It felt like a release, very personal, something I would be interested in exploring again.
It has had a positive effect on my mind. "
"I felt that I could see with my eyes closed. While tightly squeezing the eyelids I could see purple and blue like worm shapes moving in and out creating a worm soup. Towards the end my neck got painful which brought the experience to an end. 
Thank you. "
"Relaxation, connection, floating
losing sense of time.

P.S could be longer"
"It was very relaxing experience, it made me feel to be outside of me real reality. I would suggest longer session to get/fall in deeper relaxation.
Thank you. "
"Connections, core, vibration, colour, fluidity flowing, breath, shaking bubbly

Release, relax.

How everybody could be in the same room together - strangers yet connected.

Thank you for the experience. x."
I saw a misty cloudy dome with blues and purples. The mist faded then became more dense with a repeating pattern.

At one point felt a surge of something in my mind!

"A wave of overwhelming emotion. I started crying even before I had sat down. From the well of tears deep down, came to the surface. I wasn’t sure if they would stop. A release. A letting go. A wave. "
"Relaxing, able to forget worries
like I should be out in nature. "
"Felt like being in an exploratory module over planets, different coloured atmospheres passing by. Deeply relaxing."
"Very pixelated, main red dot in the middle mainly with green around it when it was getting dramatic and funky with the lights.
Music really helped, very reminiscent of Tangerine Dream, felt that it directed what I was seeing!
Sort of felt like I was in a big kaleidoscope."
"I felt like I was on an underwater journey

White light felt like I was under ice !!

I experienced floating through underwater colours and adventures as I moved along through kelp forests. Sunshine on water and I was drawn towards the sun with the orange light !!

I found it mainly relaxing but red seemed to unsettle.
The music and breathing were enjoyable and many of the shapes swirling were calming, spoiled by the Red for me."
"Relaxed - Patterns, colours and sound were peaceful. However, I couldn't clear my mind fully at times. This was easier to do when the sound was louder. "
Utter joy! I hope this is the journey when we finally pass away. 
"I watched lined patterns form which eventually revealed shapes in the middle. Whenever I tried to focus on any of the shapes they would replicate, multiply and stretch into a different set of lined patterns and the cycle would repeat again and again. I saw a green square with a light pink pattern in the middle. 
At one point all the patterns stopped and I saw a really clear and vivid starscape. This formed a square like a cinema screen which suddenly blinked further away, then further away again as if it was halving in size every two seconds. It eventually disappeared into darkness."
"Total relaxation
Fireworks exploding in vibrant colours immediately in front of my eyes
Fuzzy squares, small, flashing and squiggling
Mainly focussed on left side, less pronounced activity on right.
Started to fall asleep, experience become less intense
Main colours red, black, white, blue, orange
Dots appearing
When light/stroke pattern changed, felt like a flower blooming of super high speed. "
"Various vibrant colours taking me through spring, Spring, Summer, Autumn then Winter. I imagined life growing + living followed by slowing down + calming. The later experience felt more out of body. I began as though I felt I was in space, floating through the air in gravity, then when it got dark I was carried through time + travelled to an underwater experience where I was surrounded by bubbles and underwater life. Very calming and relaxing once I allowed myself to feel comfortable enough to let go. Living outside of your comfort zone. "
"Like going on a journey through space and time. Seeing everything and realising how small I was. At one point it felt like I was having a conversation with myself. I could feel like I was moving at great speed and the feeling of movement was intense, like I was being pushed into ‘...........’. At times I was very aware of the movement until it stopped and I could see the shadows of trees in a purple field.  "
"I saw different patterns and colours - they kept changing based on the rhythm of the music in the background.
I was thinking of how cool everything looked although technically my eyes weren’t open - visuals were presumably being produced by my brain?
I felt calm and actually fell asleep at some point although when the light got really bright, it made me a bit nervous but once it went on for a bit, I felt more excited, then the longer it went on, the calmness started to kick in. "
"At one point, at the beginning, after the psychedelic colours had begun I wondered could I create something more than colours. So drawing inspiration from the scientist who created this experience I wondered could I bring a dog into the experience. So I brought a dog into this experience and the dog began to interact with the pattern. "
"Tunnels, shapes in a tunnel of purple flowers, stars, explosions of colours. Waves of turquoise.
My mother
Being on the landing
Being on a mountain side with green grass + patches of rushes.
A blurring of the physical boundary of myself.
Yellow flowers.
Relaxed
Felt the focus was more on the left hand side of my brain."
"See - I saw red and blue squares mainly. Red coming from the top left travelling to the blue, streaming from bottom right. Behind this picture were grey circular 3D shapes rotating. When falling into a deep state saw green flecks in the centre. Similar to shards of glass.
Think - found it hard to get into a relaxed state. Thought mostly about the reminder of the day. I thought a little about dancing and driving when at peace. 
Feel - I felt warm and at peace for about 50-1 of the time. The remainder of the time I felt restless but not uncomfortable;e or irritated. 
Favourite - I love the music. Best was the abrute sounds like on the train. Influenced my sight. "
"3D shapes coming towards me. Experience of falling downwards then moving rapidly back upwards.
Lots of bright orange light that felt warm, some periods of darkness with unpleasant faces but not frightening.
Drifting in and out of the experience, I think I may have fallen asleep.
Wide variety of shapes the music faded to the background.
Some points had tiny pinpricks of light that felt like zooming through space and moving among the stars.At other points I felt like an organic network that was stretching out all around me. 
Really enjoyable
Thanks.
(I did think about work a bit, but it stresses me out all the time so not that surprised)"
"The most accurate description of what I saw could probably be the kaleidoscope effect.
Changing colours and shapes. There was a lot of white and red.
For a very short while I saw a man with a beard sitting in a chair.
I also saw for a while a slowly rotating potato crisp.
These could have been dreams as I think I had a wee snooze. "
"Feeling very dramlike, still relaxed. I had eyes opened and eyes closed throughout. The colours I saw behind my eyes were not the colours when I opened them, I saw green and deep indigo blues when there was pink lighting.
Little trails of luminous lights. "
"I enjoyed mostly the calm, quiet colours of yellow and black corresponding to the bright light and the darkness respectively. I felt very relaxed and I was able to let go. "
I was moving backwards slowly through a tunnel of light and sound but never actually went far from the entrance to the tunnel. And at the opening of the tunnel was everything and everywhere zooming towards me. 
"Time stood still. A truly ecstatic experience. Felt like I was flying into infinity.
So relaxing!
I’d like to live in the dream machine"
It was like a retro screensaver.
Fractal patterns
"Felt like I was travelling down a tunnel and then coming out to a bright landscape. Pink and orange plain, calm. Like I was going through the tunnels, I felt euphoric and spinning. Universe like, with stars."
"I felt anxiety and compression on my chest.
The stuttering music part made me feel trapped.
Then I relaxed and fell asleep. "
I revisited lots of places I've travelled to (or travelled from).
"Intense then very relaxed.
The first bit was like fischer tesselating shapes + yellow submarine video then I fell asleep.
Like being buried in sound"
"Colours dimming but also people
Great silence and joy.
Intense journey from day to night
From space to underground and from the sea all the way to a coastal.
Dimming purple in daylight and starlight."
"Beautiful light, the first time. It jolted black/’......’ was frightening.
Really loved all the colours and experience of the event. Thank you!"
"I saw an eagle. I then saw shapes and patterns and then fell asleep.
*I understand that it’s far safety but when the lights come back on after the “intro”, and the volunteers “checked” on us, it really took me out of the experience. I had a hard time getting back after. "
"I’m not sure if everyone experienced the warm yellow/orange glow that occurred a few times for me, but I couldn’t help but smile everytime it did. The first time it happened I thought “oh good, what a way to make everyone feel at ease” and then I wasn’t sure if everyone saw it. My general experience was very fluid, sometimes it scattered like light on water. Other times a lot of colours floated along in streams, like traffic viewed from a height.
Anyway I really enjoyed it."
It felt as though you were being swept into another universe…. Going into the depth of many levels of space… with fire and sound warping/flying beside and around it… amazing
"It started with an orange glowing light I found this warming and relaxing. It then started to flick in orange/red geometric patterns. This I found tiring. I felt my eyes where trying to follow it.
It changed to blue + purple colours. Those I found more relaxing to watch. The flick didn’t annoy me here. Then I saw a vivid green colour. This was beautiful tone."
"I felt amused and eager to see the next pattern - I liked that so much colour was produced in my mind or from my mind - I did feel that maybe a louder sound would have made more impact - I could see how the sound could change or influence the light patterns - or at least that ‘....................’. 
I enjoyed the layers that were produced and ‘..............’ my brain more to engage.
Thanks for the experience. "
"I could see very vivid bold colours that changed regularly. 
Mostly my view looked grid like as a map would.
This was interchangeable and could form ‘.......’ intense shapes."
"Unsettling. The music, found calming, juxtaposed with the intensity of the light, I could ‘..........’, to pull back. Hypnotic, like I was momentarily without the ability to open my eyes. "
"Lights and colours changed and moved with sound of the music.
A constant clear tone brought a bright constant yellow orange light that felt warm.
Sometimes there was a physical feeling at the top of my stomach. Like on a ride? Or a shock awake? "
"Lots of geometrical forms to begin with… mostly relaxed yellow tunnels, then flowers. Towards the middle of the experience, more astral images… waterfalls, lakes, water images… and then I felt like transported into space. Travelling in time, kind of bodily moved. It was quite overwhelming but ‘......’. Images of my distant family as well, randomly at some point. What an experience. I have never felt more connected with myself."
"Felt like looking through a kaleidoscope of a world. When I was a kid, colours of all sorts came unbidden to my eyes, fully in sync with the music and pulsing along in time. "
"Lots of different kaleidoscope-like visuals synced up to music. Very relaxing but had to work a bit to switch brain off and just go with it. Even though it’s a group experience it felt like I was in my own wee world during the height of it.
Very well organised and great staff."
"Shapes, colours, flowers.

Happiness and peace whole way through.
Bright colours followed by darkness, although a peaceful darkness.
Background pencil drawn flowers.

Eyes flickering.
Flashing stars.

Enjoyable experience,
Thank you."
Thought the experience was fantastic. Just opened up your mind and seen colour with my eyes closed ???
"Tartan - mainly green and red with yellow lines across the chequered surface.
Sometimes felt like neon and the water of a beach in Greece."
"I saw spinning globes that were both inside and outside of me. At the same time. 
At the centre was a silhouette of my dog’s head. "
"Galaxies of changing geometric patterns, morphing. Amazing combinations of colours. I could change them by blinking or looking another direction. 
It was hard to keep my eyes closed at points but I did. Although I found it amazing and fascinating to see all the changes, I did get bored. The concept and experience were so cool though, I can’t wait to see it used in other ways: spas, cinema, clubbing, festivals, theatre. "
"Please can we have a vision version with Ligeti’s Requiem as the music?
(Like the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey)."
"The possibility of grey light
Zooming focus, softness + speed, sliding"
"On reflection I can now see that what I saw, looked a lot like a bright psychedelic union jack.
Liz truss on a speed boat pulling our tiny island notion through shoals of leaping dolphins to a brighter future. "
"Total relaxation + immersion in the moment
Sacred symbols? Geometry
Geometric shapes
Clouds shapes
Underwater looking up
treescapes/canopy
Lying on back on forest floor
Fractals
Tunnels

Rebirth - imagery of embryo
Travelling through a wormhole 
Inter-dimensional travel
Post experience emotions."
I saw figures evolving from bright and ‘.......’.
Fractal patterns
"I felt totally present 
At one point the light and sound took over my body and my breath became deep and spontaneous, independent of my control. 
It was as if I was seeing what happens when you go back to spirit. 
I felt it, like that's what happens.
Euphoria, peace, safety, beautiful.
My dad was there. I knew he was. Oh. then I just kept crying.
It felt like a release and a deep connection. "
I felt like I was on a tropical kaleidoscopic holiday with warmth and peace. Thank you.
"I felt like the lights were a visual perception of sound.
I felt like if I could see what sound looks like that is what it would be!
I was taken out of my physical body and entered another realm of consciousness.
I feel like that's what it would be like to die. But with no fear just becoming at one with everyone, everything. All there is and was and will ever be.
I felt I no longer existed."
"Endless rapidly moving shapes - hexagons ‘.......’
Blurs of bright orange, golds yellow.
Sensation of immense happiness and belonging.
Sense of being at one with another realm.
Feeling of going through a portal but all was safe.
A sense of oneness with everything. "
"A visual of falling/flying/being haunted through what i imagine or would think going through a wormhole/down Alice’s rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland would be like.
Various moments of large loong white things moving across the bottom of my vision almost in processions from right to left. "
The experience felt kaleidoscopic. I was experiencing beautiful geometric patterns and also spiralling cosmic imagery. I felt like I was sinking into space. 
"Very kaleidoscope - all 3D pulsing rainbow shapes.
Colours the like I’ve never seen before. Dulux could make a fortune!
Pineapple textures shapes- sometimes above me, sometimes in front, constantly, moving.
I’m a hypnotherapist and recognise the meditative induction/breathing exercise. Would suggest it being done a little slower!"
"I mostly saw regular patterns of light coming swiftly towards me. Very occasionally the moving lights stopped - to reveal what looked like words though I could not discern what they were! Even when things went dark, there was colour - usually purple.

Also experienced bursts of light. No recognisable images. All was abstract, although heavily patterned. "
"Instead of drawing or colour, I fall into a meditation with a story of my life. Not colourful, just like I felt really relaxed. "
"Hard to keep eyelids closed at first.
Warming up sensation at the start.
Flicker
Bright
Shapes but also vivid images of an occasional scale or object.
Travel through a shifting space - was I moving or was the shape/light coming towards me?"
"At one point I suddenly felt completely “part” of the matter surrounding me, and like I’d been transported outside of my body. At first that made me feel slightly anxious, but then I just went with it and it became enjoyable and quite intense then calming. "
I felt an overwhelming sense of calm throughout. I tried a breath hold at one point for a minute which seemed to enhance the experience. The bright red periods (like looking at the sun with your eyes closed) were exceptional. I lost track of time at points and felt a wish to go further into the experience. 
"Initially thought it was like dawn then regularly like was at a match in Croke park - soaking up the atmosphere…
But strangely calm and not excited.
Possibly fell asleep - unsure. "
"Colourful. Shapes different sizes. Synchronised with music. Towards end more relaxed. At beginning difficulty relaxing little motion sickness.
Enjoyed overall."
"Felt very relaxed, emotional at one stage, euphoric.
Seen multiple colours, orange blues, greens. Kept seeing like an eye in the middle in blue and purple."
"I kept seeing red crosshairs vibrating in and out of view
Was difficult to stay focused on experience as people when snoring on either side of me. "
"Moving in and out of space towards a central light, then into areas of complete calm, like ‘......’ at the sea.
At times my mind wandered away. I didn’t see the light at all. "
"I saw mainly red, orange and white. At times what I could see made me feel manic, rather than relaxed and at peace. Like I was running down a tunnel."
It felt like I was in a ‘magic eye’ and like my eyes were open - seeing everything through open eyes rather than with my eyes being shut. Sound amplified feelings of being in a tunnel and twists and turns of my visions.
"Sunrise. Sunset.
Reflection of water and light.
Flashes. Swirls.
Checkerboard patterns.
Blue. Red. Lilac.
Golden.
Smokey. "
"Lots of memories coming back to me
Lots of bright yellow light - made me feel happy and sunny and warm + relaxed. 

Loved this experience - very relaxing!"
"Slow sunrise on a warm day, beautiful sunlight flooding my body + lighting me up.
I felt myself transition and realised I was not on earth but in the universe watching supernovas grow and explode, form anew and this pattern was cyclical beyond anything we could conceive of as humans.
Humbling and stunning. 
Nerve cells growing. All patterns replicate from nano to macro."
"Like moving through space at times.
Looking at life through a fly's eyes.
Psychedelic shapes
Amazing colours and colour combinations. "
"Various abstract + coloured images.
The most concrete was a pair of suspended feet at one point.
Really tired today + struggled to stay awake in such a soothing environment.
Couldn’t tell you if it lasted 5 minutes or 30. "
"As though everything we experience and call reality is constructed completely in the mind. As though having been created by the universe itself, all the tools we have to access it, are constructs of the mind. It will take me more time to process this experience…"
"Mostly black and white colours 
Diamond and square shapes
At times to the left and right of my vision could see silhouettes/shapes of young and old persons - no detail in their faces and only happened 3-4 times.
Not much change in headspace, I had some normal thoughts throughout.
Experience was calming, less intense than a psychedelic and a strobe. I felt a bit desensitised but calmer after compared to before the experience
Very similar to an ‘......’ light, sharing the experience with others was good. "
"I began with complete serenity. I felt at one with my surroundings and harmony with my spirit.
The journey took me through a myriad of emotions, heightening to an apex of drama + then ending with peace and utopia.
It was an invigorating and humbling experience with a kaleidoscope of colours + light. "
"It was very nice + the blanket was soft + warm.
It also reminded me of my university days and all the fun nights out and past experiences + friends. "
"I felt a physical (or what felt like a physical) pressure on me, like something was pulsing through the barrier of my consciousness. It wasn’t negative or painful, it felt like a reaching out, an attempt at contact, a polite incursion."
"It was like a kaleidoscope of geometric shapes - moving outwards from a central point, constantly moving and morphing along with changes in music I saw a whole spectrum of colours, Blues + reds then mixing to yellows, greens + even magenta, mostly very calming but a little intense at times. - not to the point of being overwhelming but definitely intense! At times with changes in music the visuals dissolved at points during the music which was a little disorientating but very cool. "
"Very intense colours, turning in circles, grids and patterns, sometimes they felt they are right in front of me, coming close, almost touching, then further away, all around me. I felt like I was in a ‘.....’ space, floating.
I felt like I was out with ‘...........................’. "
"It was intense to begin then felt like moving on light tunnel.
Similar to a strobe light effect.
Lots of lines and cubes joining together. "
"Utter relaxation - could not stop from smiling. A world of prismatic colours like a cathedral of light and the light was hot!
Very enjoyable - can you market it for individual use please!"
"I saw all kinds of shapes and colours. The bright colours was a little disturbing, the deep blue was pleasant. I thought of different things and had some insights, most of them private but here is one I am willing to share: I thought/said to myself: God, if you are there - I love you. - If you don't exist - please help me…
Thanks"
"A sense of manic Euphoria, controlled chaos and enlightenment beyond imagination.
Colours became shapes became an all inspiring lucid dream.
I felt projected towards the edge of reality."
"I can’t see images in my mind. I can’t ever close my eyes + picture e.g my house or my children. I can think in words about what they look like. I’m jealous of the descriptions of other visual journeys.
I saw lots of shapes, and movement, and occasionally ‘words’ that were repeated written in squares/circles but out of focus and unreadable. There was a lot of rotational/movement + zooming forwards/backwards I guess like how it feels to be stood in a blizzard sometimes, where sometimes there seem to be patterns and ‘clarity’ of shape and then it’s random feeling again."
"I felt on the edge of consciousness. When I was small me and my friend would close our eyes and stare at the BIG LIGHT then draw our ‘thoughts’ was so nostalgic.
I didn’t expect to see so many geometric patterns - and blues and greens were spectacular.
All tumbling over each other."
"
I felt relaxed, drifting off on a journey of my own.
Lots of different coloured lights and shapes.
It was like going to sleep and then someone turned on the light.
I saw some shapes too and some made a picture in my mind.
I thoroughly enjoyed the experience but woud’ve like it to last longer."
"I felt like I was in a giant kaleidoscope. I also felt like I was in a big triangle prism. There were so many different colors but purple was the most vibrant.
I felt like I was stuck to the seat, like I was on the fairground ride the sticky wall but without the dizzy feeling. Towards the end I felt like I was floating through blackness with squiggle lines of purple
"
Mostly red and orange colors during the bright intense lights and then blue/green colours as lights faded. Lots of patterns like glass boards and dub patterns from packs of cards in red and black. Felts a bit anxious when patterns seem to be “coming at me” the music was quite intense from too to add to the experience
"I saw rapidly spinning spheres with tails like comets or newborn stars, I felt I was being shown stars up close and galaxies rising extremely quickly. 
I also saw blocks which looked like complete “buildings” or walls.  These shapes often change in shapes moving extremely quickly. Spinning shapes was the most common theme and these went very quickly and often changed into like a pond of different colors as if there was multi-coloured dye being distributed by an Angel. I felt really curious as its what each 
shape was doing and what was set. I thought “ this is so shocking” and exciting and was hard it would be to design the experience!  My thoughts returned to enjoying the colors and shapes. I thought also this might be an extreme vision of being a baby or very young and trying to understand what I saw. Pyo"
"It was a bit overwhelming at first, until I got used to the brightness. But after a while I felt quite safe - the light was warm and the music was soothing. I saw mostly generic patterns with an overall red coloured theme. I saw the same patterns repeatedly. I didn’t expect hexagons, arches and little bubbles.I thought about the other people and wondered what they were seeing and how wonderful it is to have the same bodies but not the same experience. It reminds you that we might be all similar but our perspectives are widely different."
"It was quite beautiful living in the soundscape for a little bit, I think I could easily listen to it at home, relax, or to set an atmosphere about the house. The lightscape was almost hypnotic and mesmerising to be wrapped up in. It was a nice balance of heavy effects at the start/middle followed by the “light” colourscapes at the end. Most of the time, it felt like floating in space and being surrounded by stars and the galaxy others, it felt like travelling through a vortex. There was a quick moment where I think I saw a heart, as well a moment where I could have sworn I saw a bunch of eyes (at points, it definitely felt like I was a part of a Tool album cover. I’ve always wondered what goes through Dnny Care’ys mind to create artwork he does, and I suppose I might finally have some idea) Chaos can be peaceful, I guess. Overall, the experience was excellent, I just wish I could relieve it wherever I need to relax/distress. I really hope to get to partake in it (or something like it) again in the future. This will live with me, and I’m really thankful I got to be a part of it. Can't wait to see what might come next."
"Lots of racing shapes, geometrics and repeating colors from yellow through reeks, some deep blues and greens. 
Feeling of calm and panic in some places with the brighter lights, then a return to calm, Lots of similar  focus on sounds and light. Recurring all other thoughts."
"when the lights turned on slowly from darkness I saw deep purple
fading into blue and then to yellow like a sunrise as the music swelled. When the lights started I saw sprinkling checkerboards of deep red and black which made me full of energy.
but then this transformed into a spiral of yellow and white which was very calming. 
I kept thinking about how to think in order to get the most out of the experience. Whether I should entirely set for shapes or passively daydream. I felt much more calm when I was passively daydreaming. Overall it was a very relaxing experience and this has a lovely sense of togetherness amongst the group "
"Block colours of yellow fading to orange and reds, sudden transitions to grey occasionally turn to red rippling curtains of blue and flickering lines of electric blue, flickering in between, reminiscent of butterfly wings or laurenz diagrams, close patterns transitioning to grids and diamond patterns visually orange and red but with flakes of green, occasional ring patterns visually with a thick taurus which turns at the central field of vision. Occasional darker structures at the bottom of any field of view. Lost the sense of time at the end. Didn’t realize the session was nearing it’s end."
"Light flashes at the start in sudden bright way, it then turned to mini dots and I saw colors, pink and yellow dots, it got faster and more intense, the colors merged into a blue and red and the whitte burst came again, I then saw white again and the intensity increased until it felt like a rainbow. I felt a sense of peace and calm being with myself and aware of my breath and where I was, It felt like a dream trance"
I fell most of the time until I was shot into the Sun and back down a geometric never ending lift shaft.  I saw colours I have never seen before. Green and red mixed vibrant orange and blue. Forever changing geometric. Floating sensations.
"Deep healing and clearing in my body, mind and soul, deep knowing of things being held that no longer belong and are past there sell by date. I've moved on, I’ve got a feeling that it is very futuristic medicine of the future. "
"many visual animals, people, shapes made me crave a more visual energetic experience"
"I had three daydreams, two mundane one of Patrick the Star Fish appears in and shooting red blows out in arms and legs, 
The daydreams were quite like normal dreams. Other than that just lots of colours and patterns and stuff"
I felt relaxed at the start but as the music continued I remembered some bad experiences from my childhood and I had flashbacks of trauma that I would rather forget. I concentrated on relaxing music and this helped me focus on positive thoughts and memories. At the end I felt relaxed.
"I first started to feel relaxed and was concentrating on my breathing, then I started to think about a trauma I have about my family all the while, I tried hard to relax and put my worries in a bag and float the away, at times I was able to do this and go to a place I once was on holiday, warm, happy and  relaxed, at the minute I am feeling fine and a bit more relaxed than when I came in."
Relaxing at the beginning as the music got louder I opened my eyes. The blue lights made me feel like I was surrounded by water and I felt that I wanted to float up to the light. I found the very loud section/red lights uncomfortable to listen to. When it slowed down I felt stuck to my seat! The last section was relaxing again.
"Super relaxing time. Lovely to stop and just listen, something I rarely do.
the soundscape was reminiscent of a massage, a meditation or a yoga class, it put me in the headspace of these experiences, I was aware of the temperature of the light, the warmth of the the reds, the cold of the blues, the time spent in the  Dream Machine gave me a pause to meditate on my thoughts and concerns and think creatively, lightly about them."
"Literally I felt calm and rested and it was like I was about to undergo a spa treatment
The blue colors enhanced this, as the music changed and the colours turned to the red/orange spectrum I felt warmer and at one point the music was very intense and I wanted it to stop!
The overlay of music sounded like a helicopter, once the crescendo had thrived I again felt calmer. Visually the light was an aura, I didn’t see any shapes, just color.
"
"I felt relaxed as it begun, the breathing helped, 
At times I was thinking of the outside and things going on. Then got back to breathing
I saw bright colours starting with green then purple like clouds in a slow move, it got dark then bright, then I have seen stars as if it was traveling through space then lying on the ground in the dark with light snow, it got dark again, then bright"
"I felt very relaxed during the whole experience. Like when you are tired and decide to watch a movie comfortably sitting on your sofa….
I was thinking that I could definitely do this everyday instead of watching TV.
There were so many things that I could see with my eyes closed and resting. So many colours and shapes dancing around me. 
When it finished I felt so relaxed and ready to start the day… similar effect that I get after meditation but this doesn’t need practice or any particular mindset. I loved it "
"Can’t believe the amazing colours and how vibrant they where
The amazing patterns, especially when lights were flashing fast.
Did feel my brain going into mummy mode a few times and thinking of all the things I needed to do today.
Did go back again into music and lights
Did have an image of a baby’s face as a 3D ultrascan image
"
"Honeycomb target shapes and water 
Forgetting to breathe. Moving flames in the distance and soaring planes moving circles and slight new beams fastest lights

I often experience stress and my work and home life. I struggle to “switch off” . 
My mind is often racing when I try to sleep. I wonder if a regular “Dreamachine” would help me with this? I need to disconnect from time to time
"
"First reaction was like Sun or my face.
Some lights came on, I tried to not let my face have a big smile (make no feel awkward) but there it was, it made me happy. My face was relaxed and I was smiling whether I wanted it or not.
I try to control my thinking into not thinking about “what to see” but more enjoying the experiment.
It was uncomfortable for a bit and I tried to resist it, but then it all went spinning, very much like being drunk for the first time…
I had images of memories, feeling like a kaleidoscope, being a bee and trading through the flowers. I even had floating vision reminding me of the movie Life of Pi, anf felt like doing that rollercoaster in the dark I did ages ago. I was, as predicted very influenced by the sound (like being under water) and also made me think of Bomber war plane unfortunately towards the end, but the experience was amazing. Thank you"
"See: Colour but overwhelmingly red, with blue being the second dominant colour.
 I saw shapes and cascading flowers in my peripheral vision - mostly daisies. I saw green and purple flowers which were also shaped like diamonds. I saw an eye staring back at me.

Think: I thought it was powerful, it was unusual and after overwhelming. I maybe over thought in my determination to see or feel something profound. I had lots of mundane and random thoughts. I think a second time would be really beneficial

Feel: I felt nervous, I felt calm, I felt underwhelmed, expectation, i felt relaxed, I felt curious, I felt intrigued, I felt warm, I felt uncomfortable, I felt I was glad to have taken part and experienced it. Thank you"
"Slightly unsettling at first when the strobes started but I settled into it. The visuals changed constantly. Some seemed vastly distant, others sat right in my eyes and through my head. I looked up kaleidoscope effects and downsides on galaxies. 
When the sub-bass started in the music the visual change was so sudden I always laughed, I saw the stars as wobbly green lines. Some visuals seemed to be on a 2D plane, others 3D. Some were just moving in front of me,  others I was moving through. It ended too soon"
"Mainly a kaleidoscope of geometric shapes and colors, started with triangles and very symmetrical but would change to more rounded images. Saw lots of different colours but when the light went off it was predominantly black with purple. 
Actually I felt overwhelmed, bordering on feeling an edge/scared until I got used to the experience, then I was able to relax and enjoy it more. I focused more on the visual element than the music. Feel a little unsettled now like I might get a sore head. "
"Mozaic of geometric colours, flashing moving, sometimes lies of light like rain moving faster, furious, sometimes just colour with an eye shape, never anything natural or uneven, almost more like machine like changing from big bursts of colours , blues, organes, red, green and then featuring unto something else. Never really like a sky or natural light or other with a mad mix of ever changing colors "
"I saw first a bright light that appeared to resemble The Sun. Then lots of patterns began. Was like a dot in the distance and patterns centered around it. 
Reminded me of a kaleidoscope.
Patterns then went fast and slow in time to the music. Also lots of colours, particularly blue, red, yellow and white. Session went too quickly. Felt as though I could have done this for much longer. Loved it"

"It started out as very much just a collection of light colour and patterns, But as the experience went on it became similar to the chaotic feeling of falling asleep, various personal thoughts and feelings came to the surface alongside insecurities. I have thought about my relationships. I definitely felt myself falling asleep in several parts, but the machine brought me back and so the cycle would start again, but with different patterns turning into new images.
Towards the end I remembered the patterns turning into the visual of me underwater, crystal clear, as I moved towards the surface and broke it, it transformed into a brightly let sandstone cave and the water became a shallow stream running through it only to disappear months later. So yeah, definitely a dream like experience"
"I remember feeling a sense of wellbeing at the beginning, a wave of joy came over me, I began to feel a deeper connection with myself, my personal domain was re-ignited in my awareness. I loved the transitions between the patterns and colours. I felt as though I was alone, in a state of content, like I remembered that I am not just part of a group, I am a unique individual with a goal and journey of self exploration and self experience, this became more important for me to realize in that moment :) I thought about the movie “lawnmower man” at one point, and that was funny. I am glad that the decision to attend was made. There was a few moments I remember thinking “wow” and “holy sh*t” So that was nice i’d recommend."
"Connection
Presence
Anxious -rose up throughout- had to breath a times
very emotional, crying
Awareness heightened
Headache  came on halfway but not distracting
Red coloured shapes, spaceweb
Blue, orange, white
Music and light led soothing time
I felt my mom (passed), a moment of time out, with no distractions
It was emotionally comforting, forcing me to be open and feel. 
Relaxing initially then a rollercoaster. I saw shapes, connecting, moving and blend. I saw many orange, red, dark blue light green. 
The intense  red was sooo emotive"
"Very geometrical shapes in lots of movement coming forwards, me-away from me. Always a feeling of movement, Colours of vivid orange/luminous pink and fluorescent green shapes. 
On my periphery were white/greys stones or statues. Almost moon surface shaped. Very 3D. Some images came at me in a way that I felt my heart jump/beat faster. Towards the end I went through a mass of green bubbles/grass that I traveled through. Then ended up very much swimming through blue/ultra violet bubbles. These bubbles were all floating towards a whirlpool I could see in the distance. There we often “stretch marks” in white across the the white images. Sparkling like linear starts. I didn’t want to leave. x"
"What it made me realize was how tense and stressed I was - I couldn’t just relax into the moment- too many thoughts/worries kept intervening. 
However, I think I was very much influenced by the space I was in-
I.e the church- shapes from it were uppermost in my mind -e.g grottos. 
Nevertheless I did find it incredibly relaxing- I wasn’t aware of others around me- nor of how aching my back was and how tight my jaw was. 
All in all a wonderful experience- relaxing"
"Lots of red throughout the experience. It was very intense and more relaxing when it switched to other colours, I could see lots of shapes, almost like little prunks-baroque mostly or bathroom tiles. I kept feeling and seeing the sin at points which was nice and I felt warmer when I did.  There was also a feeling of being elevated towards the sky-like being on a plane and going through clouds which was nice. I didn’t see any images, only the feeling of going towards something. The shapes I noticed resembled colourful gassy looking shapes-like in the universe. Things seemed to slow down a bit here as sometimes the pace was really quick. When it was halfway through it almost felt like I was experiencing elements of the weather- particularly lightning strikes and blue fog."
"Colours mainly red/pink, blue and green in spaces and something like a cag wheel which appeared to show a continuous movement and numbers. At some points it even resemble hieroglyphics (?). When the white light lies at its fullest it was like lying on a hot summer day on a beach, the color diminished. 
Saw grids of blue/black/ 
Perhaps eyes slightly open and saw stone walls with uneven surfaces. stars, symbols moving in and out of focus. A relaxing experience without drugs!
I didn’t couldn’t put some words on how to describe some shapes / almost like a beehive honeycomb, my favorite colours were the pink
"
"The Sun sets as a precursor for our dream. Organic circuitry shuts down, systems repair as the please. The sun rises and the circuitry awakens again, then shuts off again, awakens again as the Sun continues to speed though the sky. Days which pass in an instant and one experiences time as the mountains and rivers do. The earth views times differently and with indifference. We are and always have been, at one with the endless cosmos."
"Like I was in a time machine. Lots of flashing patterns, rigid and sharp shapes. Moving. Also looked like stars hurtling through space. Mostly white, black and blue. 
I felt relaxed, and after a while I got used to it and felt sleepy, relaxed. 
It made me feel like I was going through a black hole or time machine."
"Movement, so much movement. Traveling through space fast and weightless. One moment The Sun was shining on me, the reset storms with lightning above the mountains.
Sometimes I thought I’d opened my eyes as I saw the moon, but realized I hadn’t"
"Mostly white and a graduation of white light, some flashes and purple, red, green. 
No yellow or blue discernible but blends of them in the green and purple- also quite a nice coral with tiny green spots.  Intensity snow-globe effect with actual snow melting.
Saw what could be either canals of the brain or small intestine.
Heard a helicopter- bit unsettling as I thought of napalm and some orange the some images e.g photos from vietnam which is interesting as a helicopter usually means someone is getting arrested, where I’m from."
"Confused, bombarded by shapes
Like I was in an extreme rave!!

At one moment I was relaxing then it felt like I was physically pulled back into the light by my face??"
"Sometimes just red colour
Then sometimes pulsating colours usually red and green squares ascending towards me.
Pale clouds, whites, blues, oranges sliding away from me slowly.
Very relaxing even though it could feel intense felt as though I was drifting off to sleep but was wide awake at the same time. Don’t feel like you wanted to leave."
"See- 3D and 2D forms shapes patterns and cylindrical tube small but going into distance with a curved small curve like a smartie tube but inviting. I wanted to explore and go down.
Also saw a man in black for a short time.

Think it was like listening to loud music in a dark room with the tire lit, stepping outside of yourself although silly thoughts about music other music losing concentration on what was happening and drifting off"
"Feel like swimming in open water 
The sea
Felt like my horizon of union was endless like to see
the shapes for miles further than my normal field of vision.
Felt comfortable at ease seemed to take a long time to come back to myself after it all ended
Wanted the experience not to end.
Would like to draw but don’t feel capable to pay true homage to the colours"
"
The experience was amazing! I felt like I was always traveling towards a central force like through a tunnel. I saw many different colours merging together like a kaleidoscope. When the music changed I saw a lot of geometric coloured shapes pulsing in time to the music that got smaller as they got towards the central force. I felt sometimes like I was traveling through the galaxy with bright colourful fish-like shapes dancing around me."
"This time was completely different. I came in with an open mind but I suppose also with expectations.
Last time felt and overwhelming sense of joy and peace
This time I felt semi distracted and my mind wandered off quite a few times. When I felt my mind wander I almost forgot that the experience was happening. I had to continue to bring my mind back to the experience and tell myself not to waste this.
I saw more purples, greens and yellows whereas last time I saw lots of reds and bright orange/ yellows.
The feeling was so completely different this time. The sense of distraction seemed to overwhelm the experience for me. It was not less interesting, just different. And perhaps less enjoyable in some ways."
"I was surrounded by a world moving very fast. It felt like the opposite of free falling - my environment was “falling over and past me”. Maybe.
Lots of colours I haven’t seen awake and with eyes closed. Unfamiliar blues and pinks. And a very intense brilliant red.
I am an actor by profession, and this experience felt, in a strange way, like what I do for a living. Emptying the mind in order for it to be filled by stimuli that will emotionally manipulate me.
"
"The faster flashing brought on a feeling of euphoria, a sensation of being incredibly relaxed, but also of connectedness, as though I could access any part of my brain, any memory, any sensation I had ever had."
"When light bright lots of colours: red, orange, yellow, pink, 
No shapes just colours as light flashes change and spirals with line shapes within and moving. Like flowers style grey, black and white.
At given times as light changed more purple, blue and green. Occasional rectangles coming out from a central point.
My brain was off onto random thoughts about characters, people I know then came to the visuals."
"Bright blue light in my peripheral vision, with white, green and red light in front of me. Felt a profound sense of awe, mixed with a little anxiety, but then the music took me somewhere. I felt deeply sad, as if falling through grief, then deep deep calm. the colours shaped into a kaleidoscope of colours mixed with images from my life- people, places, landscapes. I know I slept- I woke myself by “falling” but then I was just supremely calm. I couldn’t believe it was over so soon "
"It felt like my eyes were open and the ceiling opened up, so we could see into the sky. We were stationary, but everything in the sky was moving/traveling towards us. At times it felt like I was looking down and seeing a really long way, like into space - seeing galaxies and cities. Lots of reds and blues and yellows. A young girl with long curly hair appeared once and turned to look at me. Otherwise, much more abstract!"
"Felt like I was traveling through air or space and at times felt really cold/alone but was quickly transformed into a warm bright sort of feeling.
Parts of it were loud, like there was a helicopter overhead and really close.
Felt like my eyes were open but they weren’t. Tried to zone out repeatedly and felt like I was slipping in and out at sleep/awake-ness.
"
"Felt like I was pinned against the seat, try to get away from the lights. Quite intense spinning circles and shapes. Bright blues and yellows - white and red. Quite bright. The colors in between pink, purple or black were relaxing. Put my eye mask on near the end as felt it needed to stop. Quite hypnotic and that you’re “stuck” to the seat but awake so you can stop or leave at any time"
"I felt  for the moments when I sank into the lights, when the noise in my mind was quiet and unimportant. I felt that my thoughts were completely quiet. They would try to come back but colours and sound pushed them aside. Not in a joyful way"
"Beautiful beating colours, beginning with fine white filaments, and colours emergent. I felt a gorgeous beneficent octopus in front of me in one sequence. Underwater and space, lots of different patterns. First the patterns receding, then coming, then I tried to merge and be with the pattern and the perspective exploded to one giant lacey universe. Wonderful. One pattern reminded me of a dream I had as a child, a recurrent dream that was more like a nightmare sometimes, since I was lost in it. It felt lovely to re-experience that pattern with pleasure now. There were rock concerts, probably too Jean Michel on the music! But still pleasure. The oceanic feeling was very sweet tempered."
"Started with opaque blocks of colour, then after the flashing lights happened I saw a hypnotic colourful pattern. Many different shapes and constantly changing patterns. There was always a focal/starting point in the middle of the pattern. Shapes of colour took on different forms and melted with each other a purple/blue colour was constant."
"In the beginning I was in my mother’s womb, I then was birthed, flying through a tunnel of lights, almost like space. I saw people peering at me from my peripheral. I did not recognise their face but they were tall and lanky, with long faces. I zoned out halfway through, going back to memories from childhood that I hadn’t experienced for years. I began to focus on my breath, which brought me back. As the experience ended and the space became black my mind created the most vivid array of color I’d seen the whole time. The mind is an incredible artist"
"Felt like I was spinning and my eyes were twitching. 
I saw lots of geometric shapes, strobe lights like at a concert, honeycomb shapes, light flickering on water.
In my peripherals were very realistic people - builders with hardhats, children playing, an old woman moving in from my left, a woman handing me her handbag from my right. Old photographs from my past."
"I kept seeing an eye - it was in the centre of my focus always. It was still for most of the time but then it looked around.
I saw lots of beautiful colours -like after moments of darkness a wash of one colour (blue first, then red, the yellow) before it would melt into several colours 
Lots of star shapes and x 5 /crosses shapes"
"Thoughts were obstructed by the sound and disappeared quickly. The colours evoked many feelings- a warm day-
the sea
flowers
clouds
The staccato sound and red deep colours sounded like a helicopter - resulting in slight alarm - heart beat faster. Cool colours were peaceful and felt safe."
"Initially, a series of grey 3d like hexagonal/octagonal shapes with only a tiny concentration of red colour in a sort of “A” shape in the centre of “image”. This seemed to be a default which repeated, “tho” with gradual incursion of the red/yellow brighter colours from centre, as each episode of this “image” repeated during session.
A bright, clementine-orange colour in various shapes-another repeat pattern.
Also, a deep blue with ultraviolet “sparkle-dots” swimming in the centre of image, a bit like a galaxy - occasional repeat.
Once or twice a complete erasure of symbol or colour-not a white space, but a clear grey with slight horizontal lines across. FEELING: slight panic, as though this was embodiment of empty space or “no reaction/end of neural pathway -no response” in my brain. Note: I’ve attained this one before in a C.45 minute “OM” chant meditation
Ocassional glimpse of purple circle as concentration point of image, against a variety of other changing “backgrounds” of images. Hope this was my 3rd eye chakra!"

"At first a little scared, sounded like a woman was afraid. Then relaxed. Saw gio plants in various colours. I saw what appeared to be an eye in the centre. Later the eye was like a green box I couldn’t quite get focus on. By the end I felt very relaxed and could have gone to sleep. "

"
Lots of bright colours exploding. It made me happy. 
To begin with I was focused on figuring out what was going on. As I relaxed and began to sink into it I moved to a more meditative state of being totally relaxed. I loved the “ sun” an the beginning of each light experience and the “dark” before a new one began.
Relaxing at the beginning as the music got louder I opened my eyes. The blue lights made me feel like I was surrounded by water and I felt that I wanted to float up to the light. I found the very loud section / red lights uncomfortable to listen to when it slowed down I felt stuck to my seat! The last section was relaxing again.

I had 3 day dreams two mundanes one of patrick the starfish opening and shooting red blobs out in arms and legs. The day dreams were quick like normal dreams. Other than that just lots of colours and patterns and stuff.

"A dark blue/black hole surrounded by changing light. The light changed from hex shapes to a fluid and then all fell away to an expense of red and oranges.

Felt at peace.

Patterns such as honey comb or star shapes. During the strobe lighting a could see round shapes in the lower part of vision. If I focussed on these they were the faces of the people opposite me. I could even see these when I ensured my eyes were tightly shut.

"The most defined “real” thing, was right at the start of the main experience & that was a shadowy silhouette of an african elephant. Other than that it was mostly approaching & retreating geometric shapes almost like being in a kaleidoscope. There were moments of more organic forms. More fluid shapes. Also same moments inbetween the more intense phases that looked just like strong into deep space. It was all very cool."
"Felt like a trip from inner earth to sweeping through time and space as though everything is working simultaneously in perfected harmony, the wheel of life which we are just a tiny speckled in.

At some point and then had diagonal wiggles. At some points it was very intense though I wouldn’t make it through, but then it calmed down and felt relief when it went black and had a white ring around it and felt calm.

There were no definite shapes, just lots of colour and movement, like kaleidoscope static t.v."
"My breathing became slower and my tinitus /rimming in my ears became really loud and completely all encompassing. I eventually fell asleep. I didn’t feel or hear anything weird or unusual, it was just relaxing.

Nice to relax and focus on my breathing, which left me feeling very zen!"
"I felt relaxed and connected to my body. I felt the deeper bass sounds tingling on my face,lips and chin. My mental chatter came through at times and at other times I was fully “in” the experience. My eyes opened a few times to enjoy the soft lights. I closed them mostly. As the music ramped up I saw a flash of a psychedelic type image of a blue portal with two black gates. I enjoyed the purple visionary colours that dominated. My main thought was about how I loved music and sound therapy and I am excited to finish my course now and blend the healing sound with moments with computer music and spaces/furniture for the optimum/expansive experience for relaxation and wellbeing. Thank you."

"It felt like my mind was attached to the old windows media player. 
As the music plates it kaleidoscope between black and white patterns (hexagon/triangle) mixed with either warm reds and cold blues/turquoises. Towards the end as the softer music came in the shape changed to almost a diamond and full like snowdrops in a flowy fashion in a mix of Royal blues and purples. Continuity of images were multiple and a few gaming characters popping in. Shriveled kaleidoscopes seemed to be a common theme."
"Each image was quite different. I went to the “only sound” dream machine earlier and each experience was quite different. It was more like a meditation and I felt quite sleepy - almost drifting to sleep (although at first my mind was racing and had to come back to my body). This time though I felt really awake, I really enjoyed it and the whole experience and didn’t feel overwhelmed at all. My eyes were flickering from side to side and the images changed every time the brightness changed. There were a lot of oranges, blues, and mostly red. There were squares mostly, but crosses too."
"From the initial dark and music being introduced, everything begins with the sensation of falling asleep in the Sun. This was typically asleep in the Sun. This was typically followed by a blackout and then an intense blue/purple colour impressed you. This was then broken by the strobe light and patterns and geometry playing and constantly moving.
Intermittently this was captured by an intense almost painfully white out. Very difficult to seeing how eyes merge close at times 
The focal point kept returning to a blue calm sky and then the cycle would repeat. "
"See: patterns - geometric
very bright luminous colours -pink, peach, purple movement -circles, spinning, hexagons, waves

Hear: chords… Bb and C major stood out the most
The5th/dominant of the chords (the F4 in the Bbmajor - very emotional)

Feel: A release, sadness… the busy-ness of life and how I go-go-go all the time.
The need for a pause, to reflect. This space provided that… Thank you!"
"Started with bright light like the Sun. 
Then for most part flashing colour moving like a kaleidoscope. Purple red black. Then more of the kaleidoscope and clouds.
Near the end was like traveling through space then like lying on ground looking up then like under water looking at stars.
Bright light again then calmness "
"Sometimes the lights would make narrow bands or chequer patterns, strobing threads, and just as that was getting intensity a new shape would roll in from above, completely different, large and bulbous, rushing the flashes from the threads and in turn illuminating the floor behind and beneath, a vast plain stretching out to a cloudy horizon."
"Amazing colours and shapes
Textures varied. 
Sensations of floating in the galaxy.
Each scene had a nucleus or an eye
Eyes played a big pink… moving and growing.
Other scenes were leading me to another concept/place
Over all peaceful and tranquil… on a few occasions depending on the noise felt a little nervous… but this passed!
Feel this could induce peaceful sleep and major relaxation.
It would be interesting to introduce vibrationally  varying white light.
Each scene ended in patterns of people grey and black which indicate the end and then … providing a clearance for a new one."
"Deeply relaxing, all over, mind and body. It was in part like being shot into some abstract galaxy, in part like falling through a kaleidoscope. Load of red and green, minute pictures of things, couldn’t make out backgrounding the pattern.  
It ended too soon but anything would have been too soon. I’d love to go to sleep there (and actually may have so, for a moment) Hopefully I’ll dream about it tonight and go fully through a kaleidoscope . Loved it. Thanks, Jason
"
It felt like flying through a tunnel of complex geometric patterns. The colours would change as well as the shape and directions of the patterns. Strange thoughts would randomly materialise and when I brought attention to them would dissipate again. When the light went down I didn’t really experience much but then when it returned the shapes and patterns would take a different form. I felt incredibly relaxed the entire time and was enjoying the flow of flying through this tunnel. It reminded me of the end of 2001.
"At it’s most intense, the sheer variety of intense colours, abstract shapes and 3rd rhythm was just mind blowing.
Other sections resembled my imagined perception of what it would be like to be under a stormy sea with heavy lightning above.
A truly stunning experience set to a magical soundscape, like being on another world."
"Difficult to get comfortable, I couldn't “rest” my arms. Nor follow the breathing exercise. And during the “faster session” I felt a bit panicky that it was going to be too intense. Then the actual session started and it was much less intense. Colours were less vivid, more black and whites. It felt manic in my head as if I was traveling both backwards and forwards really fast but at the same time my physical body was getting more and more relaxed. Then it would go dark and the music slowed and I thought oh not it’s ending :( but then a galaxy of little green lights appeared in the darkness. So many kaleidoscopes of patterns and then “daylight” as if the Sun had come out and was shining on my face and I felt like I was smiling inside (maybe smiling too). + OVerall the most relaxing experience in an uncomfortable position!!
Loved it . Would definitely want to experience it again. 
Thank for the opportunity of this experience"

"Tunnels, mandalas
Perfect red spots inside perfect red squares, forever"
"Primordial sounds……
Hypnotic cosmic egg… all colours and shapes potential… some actual water fountains and falls."
It reminded me of the blackhole/wormhole from Interstellar.
"It was a good experience of my life.
It feel very relax and enjoyable. Some they I forget something it reminded me whether feel very good. I think that is good experience of my life. Which makes me feel better."
"I felt relaxed and at peace. The bright colour made my body feel warm and sent me to a good place.
It allowed me to slow my thinking and enjoy the moment."
"I see more colour light.
Relaxed with sound."
I seen myself in a wealthy life. On a holiday surrounded by money. Also seen myself as an astronaut working on inventions for the space station. Out in space with nothing but a cable holding me. 
"As I got down, I closed my eyes and felt like I was playing and everything was dark. As I was going through I was seeing planet and galaxies with I get come back."
"Different colours, feeling relax with all my body. Hearing moto, cars, something like that."
A very immersive + relaxing environment. I loved the music and felt myself drifting towards sleep as the journey went on. I was apprehensive at first but the warmth of the blanket + the comfort of the seat brought me into a rest state of comfort + peace. 
I feel good and relax. I like it. 
"The light was warm and calming.
The music was relaxing. I felt a euphoric peace when the stuttering synth played and faded away. "
Seen two females astral projections come down from the moonlighten and walk passed me. Overthinking about everyday scenario in life. I think I’d need to do it again to feel something.
"At one point I felt my sinus being massaged - I would be prone to tension headaches across this area.
I also felt i was floating at one point totally relaxed
Had to practise bringing myself back to concentrating on breathing at the beginning. "
"I see colours (many)
I think about my travel experience during this days and what it can change my future.
I feel dancing and construction my new proposal of life.
Thank you!"
I felt the music welcome me in. It was lovely to feel part of something without having to do anything. My breathing became shallow - it sometimes felt like stepping in dark parts of water. Puddles. It felt like jumping in puddles as a child. 
"Lovely, blending images of seascapes blurring with images of space, galaxies, stars.
Music was transporting - loved the way it built to a climax and then relaxed away to nothing. "
"Journey to space
Through the chakras - to God - then into space.

Colours"
"I feel like my thoughts was flying into colours.
I feel peace in the middle of thousands of thoughts!
I feel like all of us was connected in the middle of own ‘.....’ of thoughts. "
"I felt calm at some point but when the music intensified and started to judder I felt afraid.
It felt as if this experience was going to be the modern day equivalent of the gas chamber and that the participants including myself may be hypnotised as a consequence of possibly die.
Sorry! A bit dark."
"A kaleidoscope of colours
Soft then gentle shapes
Floating - being enveloped in trees
“Tasted” Lemon and later orange."
I feel that I’m in the time travel and it’s like be in the space ship. I saw lots of light and it’s sparkling and then many blue stars. 
"Boundless, tireless waves.
Blinding then black then balming.
Barraging me at points
then supporting and carrying me.

At moments, stimulating a tension within my body and at others, more relaxing. "
"I went in a virtual reality event (8) - the last few minutes I lay floating above/among the stars - I could see them.
Here - it last couple of minutes the light ws still but I wanted to open my eyes and see those stars but I knew if I opened my eyes they wouldn’t be there."
"It was like looking through a kaleidoscope at first. Then it felt like being shot through a multiverse of sounds, shapes and atoms. It felt very peaceful, like I was in the right place at the right time. Sometimes my mind would wander off and I reached a sort of meditative state between being very awake and fully asleep. "
"Colours slowly coming into view. Gradually emerging patterns and intense psychosomatic designs overlapping and coming in and out of the vast sky. Green and blue. Violet and purple. Everyday thoughts filtering in into my mind. Occasionally everything is eclipsed by a fat, black nothingness. But then other solar shapes and harlequin blue and red tornadoes fissure my unconsciousness."
"I’ve been on the experience twice, both high intensity.
For me, it was very physical. I experienced a powerful sense of rotation, movement and speed. 
Sometimes almost overwhelming.
The visuals generally mutated or emphasised the sense of movement. "
"I felt like I had climbed a hill and when I got to the top. I saw the most beautiful sunrise I had ever seen.
It became dark and cloudy and I was afraid - the sun came out again and I felt warm all over, rested, joyful and euphoric!! "
Could not hear what the guide was saying. Not relaxed and a bit bored most of the time. Didn’t like the high pitched drone in first piece of ‘sound’. Glad I did it but didn’t do anything for me. Glad to be going home for tea. 
"Feeling of ‘IN - OUT’
Reality with constantly checking if still breathing…
A bit concerned about stop breathing without taking notice!
Relative relaxation but not complete! "
"Fast    Fast in motion fast in the mix between kaleidoscope + a multi - dimensional fruitmachine operating 3D horizontal 
Vertical
Always centre point
Mostly orange - lots of colour movements at different times
Speed ot in sync to music
1970’s ‘.....’ "
"Moving from patterns to organic formations. Travelling inside leaves, following the blood streams. And just every once in a while the shadow creatures came to check in on me, leading me to the next station. Telling me when it was time to move on."
"Such bliss to simply exist in sound and light.
It would be easy to believe that heaven is like this."
I feel like my neural cells are forming waves. The glial cells are excreting some factors and nurturing the neuronal cells neurons.
"I saw my dad, who died last year and then the light filled the space, very emotional.
Lots of fabulous patterns and a heart shape in the middle.
Astral images of stars floating through space and then turning into silver fish swimming in huge shoals through the ocean."
"Felt like being on drugs. Felt a sense of wonder and newness.
Felt clarity, half way through.
Relaised (with clarity), I wanted to have a baby and it would all be ok."
"Shifting colours, getting more complex + subtle as it went on starting just red, yellow, blue, then seeing turquoise, purple, pink.
Shifting grids, swivels, lines. Relaxing and focusing my eyes shifted the patterns."
I saw a multitude of colours moving in patterns reminiscent of a kaleidoscope. Felt like a religious experience.
"I felt like it was a journey through wormholes, colours, spirals travelling and moving through space and time. As the experience deepened I felt that I was travelling through the universe until I was in the womb at the end. Experiencing my own heartbeat as a baby. "
"Cosy, first. Feeling deeply downwards but not bad at all. Like a day trip. "
"Shapes zooming in and out. Lots of circles spinning around. I felt relaxed but not deeply relaxed. Some of the visuals felt too busy and too fast. 
It was like the colours were pulling away from me, getting ‘scrunched up’."
"It felt like a ayahuasca-ish sensation, it was very meditating at first I felt like travelling in to space drawn away in this tunnel which lead to a burst of colours and all different figures sometimes I slipped away in thoughts but overall I was in a sea of love and peace.  "
"A lot of colours in fractal-like arrangements. Occasionally, there was a waving sea of blue lights, which I found peaceful and enjoyable.

Throughout, I often felt a little restless, wanting to see more than the visuals in front of my eyes but then this was intersped with times of deep peace and relaxation. "
"A tunnel of light that I could walk down. A sky. At times a staircase.

At one point I felt as though I was in the sky flying.

One of the most relaxing experiences of my life. At the same time I thought and reflected on my relationship, work and for life. "
"I saw the devil
I felt the future
I felt love
I fell asleep."
I saw bits of colours - I felt like I was on a really long spiralling tunnel. I could see people flitting past me imprinted in the walls of the tunnel. I thought they were my ancestors - specifically my grandad (great). 
"Aside from colour patterns - yellow, orange, red, green, blue, purplle - the most notable thing was that the machine completely messed up my sense of space: at some point, I felt like I was slowly sliding to my right although rationally I knew that I was not moving. Another interesting thing was that, for a stretch of time - I wouldn’t be able to say how long- I really really felt like laughing out loud: I literally couldn’t stop myself from grinning!"
"One blue circle
Pattern pattern pattern
Moving into sequences.
Occasionally monotone
Violent red and black.
Felt like dancing halfway through."
"Lots of patterns 

Mr Spock (The original)
For about 3 seconds

A hamster on its wheel. He was a creamy colour and his wheel was silver."
"Super joyful feeling
Emotional "
I fell asleep
"Kaleidoscope (sorry dyslexic!) of colours!
Squares of rainbows
Black + white stripes
Tunnels - spirals
Stars
So many patterns - squares turning to diamonds."
"Hard shapes: squares, triangles, arrows, stars (so many stars!)
Ripples of water at the end
Neon lines on lights
Red and blue over and over
Uncomfortable, stressful fun
Comfortable when dark - at ease
Zooms into shapes
Tron like neon imagery
Black and white checkerboard in between experience
Felt uncomfortable when I saw pink only. "
"It made me think what it must have been like to be in the womb.
oddly, it also made me think of death and going towards the light, but I’m in a good way, not a bad way."
"I could see the inside of a diamond constantly rotating like cogs in a machine.
I could see a central focal point with red + blue lines coming out of the centre pulsating. "
"There were every colour, I think this is the first time I experience this internally.

Geometric forms +++

Otherworldly. "
"Lots of different geometrical forms and patterns. Very different colours ranging from yellow - blue - pink.
Towards the middle of the experience I had the impression to be watching lines of numbers. "
Relaxing kaleidoscope of colours with intermittent flooding of pillar box ed. Sometimes felt I had fallen asleep. It was like being in a warm cocoon. Geometrically different shapes with a wide range of colours - Overall enjoyable and relaxing. 
"The experience was like a jump to the new dimension.
Also relax and full of intensive pictures.
Music helps to feel that new dimension/world - was a part of the experience and mystery world."
"Intense colours and geometric shapes.
Very bright red at times, at other times then blue/green.
Hexagonal patterns.
A sense of moving through space, or a tunnel.
Warmth. "
The best Ayahuasca never consumed 
"Like I was travelling, perhaps through space.
Tons of motions and lines, flying towards a central cross.
It felt exhilarating. So much fun moving so fast. "
"An open field with a massive, bright sun 
Pink + grey clouds.
A kaleidoscope of colours
Pink eyes 
Bees
Strobe lights in a nightclub.
A black and green pattern, small green limes."
"To start with it was very intense. When the light wasn’t strobing I saw a very intense red colour. A real range of emotions during the whole experience. At some points during it I was very uncomfortable but this could of been due to the fact of a massive hangover.
Thanks for the experience."
"At start found hard to relax my mind but the more I breathed in and out I became moore relaxed.
Felt very calm, less worried, body felt numb and light. Felt I was falling through a tunnel, but wasn’t. 
Scary. Nice feeling like flying."
"Critical illusion-like
Red central spiral throughout
Blinking changed the patterns
Kaleidoscope like patterns"
Drifting through yet staying still. Comfortable. Release. 
Very ‘......’ coloured lights permeated by small flashing contrasting’ - coloured lights for some of the time. 
Lots of different cubes and the like a ‘......’ of a star thing. 
I seen
Felt like I was in a slow motion of the big bang. Watching stars shoot past and then started to see aeroplanes/fighter jets fly past.
"Like I was going through a tunnel of light
Sometimes felt like floating
Lots of stars and coloured grids. Moving in and out.
Felt relaxing and interesting.
Similar to LSD. "
"I had a strange transportation of space, that I was sitting on my pals sofa, I felt very vividly like I was there and they were sitting beside me, no concept of the room I was in at all."
"Moving colours - waves which were soft and relaxing.
Geometric shapes which came towards me fast and were a bit alarming.
“Helicopter” noises and accompanying colours and shapes were brilliant."
"Minecraft environment
Mountains moving
Bricks building up - me getting smaller.

Galaxy - meteors moving
Travelling at light speed. "
The dream I had was very relaxing taking me if I was thinking of all the colours the red colours was the louds of all blue yellow green purple. In coming down to earth red was the loudest if you were in danger. Clouds drifting. 
I felt as though a small insignificant pebble sliding some primordial ooze. As the music ‘......’ so did the ooze each a peak. As if mellowed out then wave ebbed.
"Nebulas, recursive fractals, warm reds, lime colours, psyllosinic blues and purples (almost ‘......’). Rolling clouds crashing hexagons ‘........’, As star systems were born, full spectral visual beauty. "
"I loved the music. Very relaxing + middle made me want to sleep.
I would have liked to stay for longer. 
I preferred the deep listening to the high sensory experience. "
"It very interesting, too ‘......’ person’s too relaxed. The mind and body. "
"I don’t ‘think’ there are actual speakers behind the 2 circles we sat between!

I ‘wonder’ is there a ‘social study’ of some kind being carried out?"
"Much less colour than the first time I did it!
I saw faces twice and what looked like my own arm and leg but my eyes were closed!
I felt like I was on a drone or I was a drone."
I was just a floating brain seeing beautiful patterns and noticing joy and bliss. 
"I felt heat on my face. When I saw the orange and red colours and when the colours darkened again it felt cooler.
At one point I felt I was in a whirlpool (going down a plughole!!)
Weird experience don’t think I would do it again though!"
"I felt like I was in space there was lots of dark blue, then I fell in a trance with shapes zooming past. An orange flower kept reappearing and I seen stars and rainbows. Thank you for the experience."
"Blue crosses rotating 360 degrees.
Sun share with orange rays coming off it
Blue and red dotted patterns
In the middle of the experience, I saw red and white alternating squares. "
"Mostly pulsating red and blue light rotating clockwise and anticlockwise. Athe centre, I could see what looked like a cross shape inside a bright circle of light. At one point, solid blue light which accompanied the gentle music."
Fear - inwards - emotional - electric music of late 70’s (OMD - Gary Numan - Kraftwerks - Mike old field) OMD Album - ‘Sound most dominant sensory - removed - other. 
"Very calming and relaxing, could have easily stayed in longer. Time wasn’t a thing. "
"The first colour I seen was bright red, then it transitioned into the most beautiful hue of orange I have ever seen. It felt like I was approaching heaven’s gate."
It felt like the process of life - beginning in my mothers womb. I noticed the sounds mimicked a heartbeat.
"I’ve seen a lot of colours, very bright colours.
Felt very emotional when I’ve heard calm music, was thinking about waking up in the sunny morning. Then I imagine that I’m close to the sea. Very powerful."
"I saw a field at sunset.
All the blades of grass were yellow and red. "
I felt that the sands took me through the journey of life getting stormy or more turbulent in places but always returning to my breathing and calmness.
"Feel calm + relaxed
Alternating patterns sometimes it felt like the sun was rising.
Top of the pops 2042 lol"
"I felt like I was travelling through the universe and through the stars.
Completely forget where I was and what I was doing. Felt weightless and forgot that time existed. "
"I saw lots of purple + green shapes.
At one point I felt as if I was arching my body, and the white light was coming out of my chest. "
"Aware of the light around me. I felt warm + safe like there were friends around me. I was unable to relax completely and my mind kept wandering to shopping, food etc."
"In the middle of something looking in at something expanding from something and leaving something. 
Coming in waves
Cubes n’ shit."
"Light grey background, orange - flower at one point red - 3 key colours.
Later some green, light green and a more vivid green.
Second Time doing this - first time do not remember much after first few minutes. This time was mostly conscious of what I was seeing. 
Felt relaxed, enjoyed experience. Watched patterns happening and forming in front of my eyes."
"Lots of small mosaic squares
Block colour with white and green smaller circle shapes
Looked like very small red mini hands although waving about.
Large circles floating into small white circles."
"Like a very fast kaleidoscope
Turquoise Blue/Red rectangles rotating
lilac/grey grid line
Black sky with stars flickering
When the music got deeper in tone and less musical, the patterns became less rhythmical."
"Vibrant colours - green + red together.
Geometric shapes fading in and out felt like I was flying through the cosmos. Grid shape - like graph paper from school.
Felt sadness when it ended - I wanted more. Very relaxed. Feelings of exuberance when flying through stars. Amazing. Thoroughly enjoyable experience."
"I felt like I was being watched, yet completely alone at the same time. I kept seeing eyes, red eyes, over and over. Grey doors and neon writing. It felt like anytime I got close to entering the light went dark again."
"I felt like I was travelling
Moving forward but calmly.
I felt as though I was underwater, sinking down into the cool water.
I saw lots of faces, almost like they were in the clouds. I could not focus on them but they looked like old movie stars from the golden age of cinema.
The faces faded as I tried to identify them."

"Colours I never knew existed 
Colours together that i would never put together
Sense of awe
Emotional 
Step out of the world we live in.
Utterly stunning."
"Relaxing, light, weightless, calm. Just me travelling through a tunnel of beautiful explosions of colour, feeling of peace, timeless existence, without peace. "
"Flowers opening.
Helicopter landing.
Landscape/sunny day - turning to clouds."
"I felt a great sense of peace. Like a feeling of floating in a beautiful space. 
I felt transported to another world. A world of peace + tranquillity.
Wouldn’t it be wonderful to live in that peace.
I could see fields of wildflowers with amazing colours dancing in a gentle breeze.
Wonderfil clouds going by.
I also felt a physical presence.
The music was so relaxing + not loud."
"Radiating colours of lights coming from a brighter middle
Ripples spreading through the colours
Points of light throughout the colours
The sound detaching from the lights and moving into my head (through the speakers behind my head)"
"I saw a variety of things as the music changed, but my main vision was of birds and giant icy quartz crystals, and flight and waterfalls.

I closed my eyes for most of it. It was amazing!

I felt floaty and light, almost like my body didn’t exist. I would have loved to stay there!

Main colours: icy blue and light orange. "
"Total relaxation with out of body feeling - at peace, beautiful light and images. Different colours and patterns. Brain was allowed to relax and see what it wanted to see. Music was calming and lovely to have opportunity to sit and relax. Tired now and ready to sleep - nice to switch off with no screens - no distractions.
So individual - our own experience based on our own body."

"Angst
Anticipating attack - aliens? End of the world!!
But also
Letting go - slowing down, release, lightness
Was anxious about needing to take my tablet, so didn’t let go for a while. "
"Undulating orbs of colour, interspersed with grids and checkboards. At times I was bathed in sunlight like a summer day. "
"I felt completely rooted, my hands were firmly stuck flat to my legs.
The orb above changed colour in my mind over and over, mainly blue.
I experienced my yoga movements vividly. "
Everything was clearer in the dark.
"I left immediately the lights went out and moved in the reflection space, using the bean bags and a cushion as partners in my dance.
I wanted to experience the Dreamachine and believe in its aims - but I can’t find it in myself to do so in an organised group.
However, I have very much enjoyed moving to the ambient soundtrack which I hear in the reflection space. "
"I saw orbs of colour. Grids, checks, cubes, fuzzies that all melted into one another. At times it felt like my eyes were wide open and I was standing inside my head and it felt like an empty room. I could feel myself sat in the room the experience took place in but everyone else disappeared and I was outside of my body. I saw blues that melted into blocks and warmth. "
"Checkered everywhere mostly black and white. At first I felt panic but I slowly fell into a numb outer body state. It felt like I was floating or part of a simulation, definitely social experiment feelings and vibrations. It felt like what space is shown like in movies. It felt like the closest I’ll get to an acid trip. Crazy. Weird vibrant. Floating. Not me. Like I was watching me from outside. "
"I felt incredibly relaxed and at peace, the colours are indescribable, flashes of blue, violet, green and pink filled my “vision” and formed into infinity rotating and bouncing crystalline shapes. I felt as if I was travelling through time at an accelerated rate, I felt as if I had moved, ‘......’ not at all. It’s absolutely astounding what a combination of light and sound can make us feel! And how by limiting our most viral sense we can boost our minds' understanding and perception. "
"This was my second time. Compared to the first this was more intense and focused. Colours were lighter, visuals more varied.
I felt a real paternity with these beautiful images in front of my eyelids.
I saw dappled white with an underlying 6 pointed star shaped kaleidoscope. This moved in oval shapes with ‘......’ rapidity.
Towards the end all these shapes and fluttering lights somehow resolved themselves into the shape of a trilobite. I also saw a batch of wriggling maggots. "
"I felt such an incredibly intense sense of all-encompassing well being. I kept feeling time was speeding and I felt the need to try to regulate it more.
I wanted to dance!"
It's lovely to have time out from worries and just to be in a space. 
"A big eye orange one looked like a flying saucer. The blue eye looked like sky felt like I was staring into unlimited blue sky.

Nice to take one hour to slow down."
"Relaxed, calm, safe + secure.
Loved being guided by the sound along the journey, pace moving faster, louder and passages of quiet contemplation.
I saw colours of yellow like sunshine and could feel the warmth from it. 
At one stage near the end, when the tempo changed I saw a black screen with a far away cobalt blue light. I felt I was moving towards it.
I felt renewed and energised from my experience of the golden light. 
Colours of green danced like the Aurora borealis, shifting + swirling slowly. "
"This is my second time doing it. And 2 very very different experiences. Last time I had a lot more clear patterns + colour. This time things seemed more muted. Less colour and pattern. More blurry.

Great experience. I loved it. Thank you. "
"Edges of rainbows
Eight - and ten - pointed stars

A sense of being massaged and stretched
A sense of forging and letting go a deep sadness yet knowing not to be alone. "
"Love + Light    Beautiful flowing colours.
Changing    Blending    floating up and 
Deeper colours downwards     beautiful faces.
Soft smile
Deep feeling of love + protection

"I didn’t get it, couldn’t switch off and didn’t dream at all. Felt a bit fidgety and bored (sorry). I probably would have benefited more from the high sensory experience but couldn’t as I have epilepsy. "
"I dreamt back to past times abroad while on holiday
Conversations with my friends that I’ve already had
Driving in my car on a road I hadn’t seen before
Tingling sensations in my body could feel my face twitching
I was still half conscious that I was in the room but I could feel myself drifting in and out of dreamstate it lasted around 25 minutes if felt like less than 10."
"Felt relaxed
Thought - sometimes the music made me think of bugles - (horn)
Sometimes felt like I could see colours + shapes + opened my eyes to see if it was linked to the room. Though the room had stayed the same. 
Colours - red, purple, blues
Sometimes a central hexagon or eye shape. Sometimes the perception of travelling or zooming in to the central shape. "
"Relaxing, calming. When eyes closed focusing on sounds I could see shapes (twirling + strip-like) in one colour which changed as the lighting appeared to change, kaleidoscopic like."
"Peacefulness: relaxation: memories.
Calming, think I thought I was on the strobing and (my friend booked) so I was sort of creating that.
I saw an unpleasant dark splodge at the start but I think that was where I had a tear in my retina lasered.
Colours were lovely made me think of the sky at sunset - dusk. My favourite time of day."
"Vision of my children getting married extremely happy
My new relationship - I was extremely happy - Love to me
Commitment to me.

Visions of the future - happy - content
Felt calm/peace/at home.
Sense of out of body experience. "
"I kept having the recurring image of a square with lots of squares vibrating from that. In bright yellow + red. It made me think of a tabernacle in church. I kept thinking is this my mind? Lots of opposing forces. Passive aggressive? I tried not to judge and just enjoy the journey. 
Interspersed with purple image. Trimmed in black - this was calming + blue + white patterns. kaleidoscope? "
"Iridescent bubbles, sunlight, glitter

Total relaxation I went from feeling like I was sat out in the sunshine to soaring through a kaleidoscope. The hair on my arms and neck were almost always standing up.
"Colours 
Shapes 
Spinning
Very like DMT"
"A large range of colours + gentle music which made me relax.
Deep emotional thoughts. 
Think I fell asleep!"
I felt completely relaxed and probably almost nodded off to sleep.
"Spinning (uneven)
Flying through space
Relaxing
Like a kaleidoscope.
Orange felt like a surrounded colour colour beyond edges of eyes.
Like meditating - felt the group, focused deliberately on ‘......’ for self and others. "
"Beautiful kaleidoscope!

Felt I relaxed into it, enjoyed it more and more throughout…
Almost like a meditation session

Thank you…"
"Incredibly anxiety provoking, but in an intriguing way that made me want to fully delve into the experience. It was uncomfortable in a comfortable way, if that makes sense?"
"Travelling through almost circle motion
Hexagon shape patterns. 
Purple patterns.
White flashing dots
Bright orange like sunshine"
"I felt very relaxed. The bright lights at the start made me feel like I was on a beach and it felt like the sun was making my skin feel warm. 
At times I felt like I couldn’t move nearly like I was being held down by force.
I saw lots of shapes + colours. I felt like there was a figure standing over me."
"I seen a bare tree with veins running through it in many colours - like the tree was getting fed by a rainbow.
I felt anxious at the taster - but then I was ok. "
"Being + becoming
Energy
Creation and destination
Death + life
Oneness + duality
Immersion
Birth
Passing away
Transcendence
Impermanence 
Closeness + distance 
Creativity
Returning
Passing beyond
Coming back."
I saw a light show - different colours - several mandalas - it was like looking through a kaleidoscope. Lots of thought went through my mind but there was no coherent narrative. It was a pleasant relaxing experience. 
"A ‘central’, strongly coloured point from which more blurred colours radiated. Many diamond shapes in grids. Then a greyer, more dappled texture much like a bird's breast.
As I moved my eyes, the yellower colours changed to reds and pinks."
Like travelling to a realm beyond this one. Sense of being transported through reality.
"Feelings of being travelling in space
Seeing shapes of people holding my hand
Good strange"
"Variety of lights, sound + vibrations to relax with colour blending in - at my age now it could relax me to sleep. "
Relaxing - aware of changes of colour by change in music. Drifted in and out of mindfully relaxing + listening. Different thoughts floated in and out of my mind. Calming. 
"I felt like I was in the womb, hearing a heartbeat and feeling some light come through to my eyes.
I felt very heavy at one point, but as I continued to breath slowly I felt myself getting lighter and lighter until I was air."
"Waterfalls morphing into forests morphing into birds into the sky
Into space
Floating
Colours
stars."
Normally eyes closed seems like 2D black wall but that felt like a 3D space. 
"Bright lights - Red, White, Checkerboard.

Lights fading - Blues, Purples, Blue lines/lasers/space.

Fractals.
Letters.
Numbers.

Forest colours, whites.
                         White purple green fractals

Whole body buzzing at the end."
"I felt very nice + arm like the sun was shining on me at the beginning.
When the shapes + their rhythm became more intense I felt giggly + happy + I couldn’t help but smile. "
"Chains and shapes made of geometric shapes, sometimes like you’re moving through a tunnel, sometimes looping together. It reminds me of videos of zooming fractals, layered over each other and blurring together. Mostly red/orange, some blue, very little green."
"I saw mostly orange but did see a range of colours. 
This is my second time + saw way more colours this time.
I saw crosses and shapes in the middle that resembled eyes.
I was thinking a lot about what I was trying to see and trying to relax.
I did feel very relaxed + comfortable.
Thanks. "
"Very peaceful, dream-like. I saw a lot of red, spinning shapes. At the end everything was yellow and gold."
"Waves of fractals moving in sync with the music. Bubbles hovering in and out followed by triangles shapes that kept beating.

Floating blanket like shapes emerging from the sides inwards at the same time a tunnel of red shaded circles kept spinning."
"I saw all the colours of a prism explode across the universe.

The way each colour blended was serene and beautiful.

P.s. I also saw Batman, the space and time vortex and a lot of fidget spinners. "
"Helicopter
Lots of shapes
Roof tops
Colours black + blue felt like out of space
Orange colours felt like sunshine and beach. "
"An egoless experience. An echo of an institution personal to me. A range of fractals with eyes and a pencil writing on a page. A riot of colours moving in regular shapes, left to right, right to left, up to down to up. Pulsing from centre then to a centre."
"My feelings were of summer. Lying on the towel. 
Feeling the warmth of the sun. The gentle sea.
Trees tickling my face. Geometric shapes."
"I felt very relaxed
It was like meditation but 100x better.
My inner monologue was very loud. It was mindfulness. 
Very relaxing. Lots of shapes + colours.

Important to keep an open mind throughout."
"Bliss
Resilience 
Centeredness
Love
Joy
Easiness
More love
Surrender
Trust
Hope
Being
Silence
Quietness 
Enough-ness
Fluid
Soft"
"I enjoyed seeing different patterns and colour combinations. Same points felt a little-intense, I appreciated the more chilled out parts as it was less overwhelming and I could get to a more immersive place. "
"I wanted to dance, pull in the space around me and absorb the energy and light.
I loved the orange. Surprisingly relaxing and the cool depth of the blue with ‘......’ hues of other colours. "
"A term which comes to mind is sacred geometry.
I’m reminded of drawings Zulu warriors made after imbibing a home brewed amphetamine, they drew similar shapes, structures. Maybe expressing a commonality in our visual processing.
Shapes and colours were so varied. Patterns of spots, sunsets, triangles…."
"Short experiences of different realities
Tunnels bringing me in and out of these
Bottom of the ocean - very dark.
Buildings 
Structural people
A surreal experience of being outside, at the home I grew up.
General psychedelic experiences.
My deceased mum as ‘something’ in the tunnel, me being pulled towards her and away from her. "
"Started with sunrise and the dawning of a day.
Went into chaos - almost all the thoughts (although I had none) jumbling together.
Going down to the depths of the water (blue) and going into ‘space’ - movement.
Then the chaos becoming less so, resulting in calm. "
"Geometric shapes in motion
Vivid reds and blues
Pale greens in blackness - wavy lines 
Lots of movement - very intense
Tunnel vision"
"Jackson Pollock meets Andy Warhol on a clubby night out, with splashes of Dali, Escher and Gaga thrown in.
Physics Fractals then shattered glass into millions of diamonds.
Primordial soup at the birth of the universe
Peripheral castle walls and a railway trip through a dark tunnel. "
"Mixture of 3D shapes of cubes, prisms, spirals folding in on each other, sometimes I felt like I was falling down a purple (dark) tunnel with spiral shapes then to be pulled forward in a blue/green tunnel with cube shapes.
IN between the tunnels I saw the grey shapes in a dome spin - at times it felt as if i was about to be hit with the flying shapes. Though I felt safe.
When it came to colours yellow + violet it took like the sun at this point I found myself bored hoping for the fast moving colours.
Grey - safe  blue - excited as there had the most interesting shapes
Yellow - bored    and speed.
Violet - bored"
"Depending on the combination of flickering light and the flavour of the music the colours that my mind projected and patterns was very different.
For example warm colours with more soft music but with the flickering light really amazing patterns in really warm colours. When more intense music. I could see more blue and green patterns. Once the light stopped there tended to be purple patterns/lines on a black canvas.
I felt like I was floating around in my own mind without any rhyme or reason, just relaxed and taken on a journey into myself, a unique own never experienced before. It felt safe and like I don’t have to understand what I saw, it was beautiful. "
"There were so many patterns and moving shapes that it seemed too difficult to sumit up in one drawing. I feel like I needed to pause so many times and describe what I saw!

The colours definitely evoked different emotions. The periods I experienced green and purple were very periods I experienced green and purple were easy, calming and pleasant. Anytime red and blue appeared together were often accompanied by geometric shapes, but the overwhelming feeling was fear. Not fear that made me want to stop, but I was fascinated that I experienced it. 

There were lots of images of travelling that appeared from time to time. There was an aeroplane heading from right to left, people travelling by bus. 

I have to rebook to experience more. "
"I didn’t feel particularly emotional, the experience was mostly visual. I was surprised at how geometric and fractal the visuals were. Lots of red, blue, green. Grids, a triangle, only one circular object that revolved, was ‘......’. I was thinking about really boring shit. The dimming was physically, very intense. I'd have loved to see what I saw on a big screen. I’d love to go high. I wanted to stay there forever. Felt so peaceful. Soundtrack was bangin.

Looming in, zooming out. Like those 4 hour long trippy animations on youtube. Nothing I didn’t recognise.

It wasn’t like outer space at all. "
"Control, letting go of that control. Looking and submitting.
Forgoing.
A dreamstate watching stories and moments play out that did not make sense. Witnessing interactions.
Lost awareness of who I was, of time, of my surroundings - yet not fully.
Pace.
Entering a state where I became a witness, rather than an actor. Watching moments with discomfort as I realised their lack of viable possibility. I feel like I entered a dream. I submitted control and stopped directing what I saw. A process of rejecting a need to search for meaning or analogy. Allowing myself to be consumed by the experience. 
Stages: Ability to dictate
             Feeling myself change place
             Discomfort at what I saw - Not discomfort but confusion. "
"Emotional and uplifting colours and sensations
Immense calm
Dancing psychedelic patterns
Warmth ecstatic uplifting 
Visions of my dad who recently passed away
Connected to a higher power."
"At first everything felt warm and I got the sense I was “inside” the sun.
After that I became aware I was on a journey and I was being given a sneak preview of the afterlife and how at peace it feels.
I would return multiple times to my ‘journey’ image which felt like being inside an electric wire travelling very fast.
After previewing after life I was taken back to reality and given a fast forward. Summary of life so far before going back to journey, image and seeing what was still to come.
Towards the end as music calmed, I felt I was being taken to a different reality but then the experience ended before I was allowed to fully see it.  "
"So many different patterns. I felt taken away, out of body. And completely at peace.
To me, I became the space between realms, turning, twisting, bending, growing, stretching. Being the void and filling the void."
"Test phase - felt like sunrise, or when you see a baby in the womb that orange light, or perhaps being born into the world.
Also felt like rave lights at one point.

Main event- again sunrise, orange light almost like when optician shows you the back of your eye.

Lots of red + blue lights at one point
Purple bouncing lights like raindrops
Green lasers

Sometimes light felt really bright
Then at times I felt like I had zoned out or gone into some kind of meditative state."
"It felt like interstellar. Lots of shapes coming and going at very high speeds, and lots of shapes spinning.
A kaleidoscope of colours and shapes.
I felt very relaxed and know I fell asleep, however it didn’t feel like I was sleeping and my thoughts still felt active, and slightly passive, but not as much as a deep sleep. The only reason I really know I fell asleep is because I can’t remember most of it. Strange flashes of memory. I feel like I allowed myself to feel some form of transcendence, which was nice… To let go and give in to the experience. "
"Intense in a very positive manner. Ever changing colours, patterns and pixels.
My mind was initially focused on the novelty of what was happening, but once I became accustomed to what was happening I went into an amazing dreamlike state. I felt like I left the room, many times until my mind reminded me of where I was.
Overall it was fun! Also enlightening.
Would love to know what my experience would be like if I had taken shrooms just prior to entering. "
"So. many. Colours.
Geometric shapes all exploding out from any origin point.
Kind of looked like in sci fi movies. Where spaceships are flying through space really fast.
I felt small, in a massive universe, awe inspired.
Different colours represented different energies. The slower paced sections. Were blue + green, the faster bits were red, orange, purple, yellow. "
"Main colours reds, blues, purples
When darkened greens appeared.
Further in blues with different shapes colliding.
Last section had a greeny blue mixed ball with red-y blue-y violet-y colours kinda spiralling around it. Like the eye of a storm. Again no clear shapes
Kinda like an enjoyable k-hole.

Overall completely different from my first experience a few weeks ago."
"This is my second time coming. I couldn’t relax last time as I’m a full time parent and couldn’t allow myself to have me time. This time was a different experience. Purples and blues stood out. The music was like a scene in a film. I could picture trees and I’m standing looking up. The trees are covering the light coming in. It's dark, lonely and depressing. But then the stomps in the music happen and the light starts to shine through. This is hope! I felt the music was very emotional. I could feel the release of tension of stress. I felt soothed. I could feel I finally gave myself “permission” to be free. I relaxed. I ‘let go’. So glad I came back to try this again. Don’t give up hope."
"Patterns, multi-faceted. Form faces - not familiar, helicopter noise was strong in parts. Sometimes got drawn or lapsed back to ‘.....’ issues in my daily life, but shrugged these off quite quickly, and then fully. Didn’t want it to end, didn’t like the periods of dark. ‘......’ once or twice to see ‘......’, but couldn’t get ‘......’.
Is this where my real self exists? Could do with more ‘....’ - distracted, reflective experiences like this.
Wish I could see more detailed/patterns like this. ‘.....’ to let them go. "
"Attention everyone! I’ve got an announcement to make. Sonic the Hedgehog is a not nice guy who likes his mother a lot. He, in fact, is really good friends with my wife. So I’m making a callout post on my twitter dot com.
Sonic, you smell you’ve got a small guitar pick its the size of this walnut except way smaller and this is the size of my guitar pick *loud noise*. All points, no quills, no pillows and guess what, I’m getting my revenge, here it is, my super laser guitar pick fluid *loud noise*. Sonic, you're good friends with my wife so I’m going to be good friends with the earth. Except I’m not aiming for the earth, I’m becoming friends with the moon. Take that Obama you idiot. You have 23 hours before the fluid droplets hit the earth so get out of my sight before I spray it on you too. "
"What an amazing experience - eyes closed yet I could see, fear, but no threat, floating, relaxing, “with” but alone - JUXTAPOSED. Amazed + amused at the colour, the colour inside my own head, my biology? My imagination? Something outside of me but how does that happen…..
Loved it!!!

How fantastic to be a human - seeing without seeing. "
"I felt like I was sometimes travelling through a moving kaleidoscope of changing colours and patterns, with smaller fractal patterns resembling small eyes and also looking like colourful scales of fish; I saw swirling rainbows guiding me through a kind of tunnel. Sometimes I saw shadows and what looked like faces of different people. At times, when the light got brighter I could really feel warmer and blissful as if I was in bright sunlight. At other times things were more still and subtle and I felt rested - all in all I saw a lot of different, always ‘.........’ colours, shapes and patterns. "
"Initially I felt claustrophobic when the door closed and it was dark but I relaxed once the lights started. I find it mostly a peaceful experience - almost meditative - and, like meditation, I tried to give myself up to it without the usual mental “noise” from my own mind. As usual, my intellectual/analytical mind stepped in and started analysing the sounds - their pitch, duration and type. When I just listened without analysis it was a reflective, calming experience, except for the descendant sound towards the end which sounded like an aeroplane engine - a sound which resonated through my body and the seat.
I didn’t really leave myself behind as I expected to but I did enjoy it and would have liked a longer session to experience its calming benefits. "
"Unique and amazing experience.

Colours shapes and souls, sensory stimulation leading to peace and calmness. The music was so atmospheric and enjoyable, complimenting the experience.
So many different shapes and figures like hieroglyphs and building assembled and disassembled. "
"I saw many geometric shapes and moving line patterns. I also saw many souls travelling upwards in a twist. Some core memories unlocked: moscow theatre terrorist attack and Beslan massacre from the news.
I saw kids walking my way and also the word ‘injustice’ kept coming up.
Lots of reds, blues, and greys."
"Astonishing and rather overwhelming - i couldn’t stop crying and having to try to keep emotions at bay - in a really beautiful way. Cathartic. (I’m a guy).
This was like the stargate in 2001; the projection onto a near-space somewhere ahead of the eyes. (blind subjects who experience optical stimulation also report this).
The geometric shapes - why geometric - why like a living, moving Mondelbrot set - of regular-sided shapes - why not more organic, soft-sided shapes? Helmholtz and physiological optics and the imposition onto the outer world of perceptual experience - meeting the world halfway - yes, but why not organic shapes?
This was so absolutely enjoyable, sublime and I would buy a personal version of this in a heartbeat - or make it - Dreamstations, playstations."
I felt pulled into the universe. I am so grateful to have this body to experience the world and all its magic. I felt like I had fallen into a kaleidoscope. Lots of colours and wildly alternating patterns. I imagine this to be like moving through galaxies. I feel connected to humanity. 
"Fast paced, like moving through time or coming out of perspective to see a wide expanse (like flying on a plane)
Small shapes that seemed like cities or motorways from a distance
Warm colours, like being on a beach - where your eyes are closed but the sun is beating down on you
Blues, reds and bursts of yellow. "
"Most was spinning patterns. Lots of fractal reds and blues, lots of worm-hole like visuals. But there was a moment of about 1 second when I clearly saw train tracks. It was as though I was in the drivers cabin watching the tracks in front of me as we travelled. Then the light pattern changed and it was gone. But it was so vivid, could have been a video. "
"I felt as though I was flying through space really fast. My body felt as though it was sinking into the chair. I wanted to catch a hold of the picture sometimes, but I let it go. There was lots of triangles + it felt as if I was in the centre of something spinning very fast in two opposite directions."
"Felt like I was inside a kaleidoscope!
Also elements of being under an extremely bright sun bed.
At times there were feelings that I was drifting in outer space and staring at a dark sky populated by different coloured stars.
I had no awareness of my own body and at times felt completely unaware before being shocked back into awareness by a particularly bright light."
"In my experience it looked as if I have died and time and space merged, I started dancing… I moved through space and time only to end up on a meadow on a sunny day suspended by the endless amount of dandelions "
"A lot of geometric shapes and patterns which felt like they were exploding at me, with a central focal spot - like the light or dark hole as seen through a tunnel. The images tended to explode outward toward me, but also change in waves. It was rather like looking through a kaleidoscope at speed. "
"Kaleidoscope images flitting into sunshine oranges and warming yellows. Variety of images and colours. Initially a little chaotic and scary, calming into a very relaxing meditative state. "
"Intense , colourful, dynamic and full of pulsating movements. Relaxing in body but with an intense mental and visual experience shapes often hexagonal or straight lines/sharp angles moving in broad circular movements. "
"Familiar, yet on a bigger scale
Emotional - connecting with my mother.
Doorway, appearing wanting to go in yet not, submitting to the moment. 

Sunshine

I love how the patterns experience changes as I look up or down - eyes closed.

At the end journeying backwards, like…"
"I was in a portal between our world and an extraordinary universe of colour, nature and harmony. It was beautiful to be at peace with the unknown expanse of our consciousness.

There is so much light within the darkness. It’s accepting the darkness that makes us able to see it.  "
"To start with the intensity of the patterns, movement and colour were disorientating but will focus on breathing I relaxed to a point of acceptance then completely phased out. My mind had lots of clear ideas completely unrelenting to the lights and the phased back to focus on the light patterns."
"Euphoric , other-wordly, out of body experience, psychedelic, shapes, colours, like entering another dimension, space being endless, lost sense of my body, like a big pair of hands holding my hands, smiling almost laughing, felt particles of me pulsating, so enjoyable, a delight to immerge myself wholly into. Warm colours, trippy, cool palettes, zig-zags, whirls, clockwise vs anti-clockwise rotations, deepened sense of psychedelic visions with deeper breaths of inhalation, otherwise were more dotty. Like a flotation experience, and then taking off into outer space. No boundaries. Endless infinity. Layers. One incident of a twitching sensation but otherwise therapeutic. Climax near the middle. Patterns. I didn’t want it to end."
"There was a perpetual sense of forward momentum that was especially distinct during the sequences of darkness and steady white light. The early parts felt akin to something subatomic or biological and microscopic. There was a beautiful cascading sensation in the middle that was like drowning in autumn leaves and being engulfed in frogspawn.

The geometric tendency towards crosses in the centre of my ‘vision’ made me consider the universality of those forms in religious experiences. Most of all the forms made me think of peruvian weaving patterns."
"At first it was an intense bright light - I would be afraid to open my eyes because it would be blinding - but then I went travelling through space! I could see geometric shapes in primary colours - blue, yellow, and flashes of red behind. The shapes looked like grown-up colouring books - soothing, geometric shapes, constantly shifting but fitting together. On the fringes just out of reach, were spec or stars., like I was travelling through space or a wormhole - those galaxies were just zipping past me but I couldn’t catch them!
I zoned out or fell asleep as time passed without me noticing!"
"Initially preoccupied with how it worked, then drawn in. The bright colours made feel warm and a bit cross! Sometimes smiled inadvertently at some sequences.
Completely focused the mind and it was almost impossible to think of anything other than what was unfolding in front of me. Not at all afraid or ill which I thought I might be the case, no epiphanies or god-like experiences.
Experience was accessible and inclusive. If I did it again would/experience be same sequence? What do you do with all this data?
Flew by.
Can't translate what I saw into a picture
Suitably relaxed.
Movement, felt movement + heat - like 5D simulator flight - ‘......’ to what to people - mindful - took mind off body. "
"A mixture of a lot of thin grey and white cloud, patterns of colours moving across the horizontal line and middle vertical line. Sometimes occurring together. Varying kaleidoscope type patterns of shapes. Mostly orange and red but sometimes dark blue and purple. Sometimes the full visual was an orange peach colour.
The patterns appeared at different speeds and sizes.
I’m not sure I felt that much, moderately relaxed, neutral emotion. "
"At the start I felt very overwhelmed as I had never experienced something like that before. I cried a bit as it felt almost very relaxing. After the tester. I started to calm down and felt very at ease. It almost felt like I was going through galaxies in space. I saw a lot of patterns in the colours blue, yellow and red. Many different shapes intertwining with each other. At one point I saw white birds flying out from the middle of my vision, almost like they were symmetrical. "
"Just super chilled out really. Mostly seeing weird abstract patterns. A lot of it was like the opening titles of Doctor Who. occasionally saw weird, really random images of actual things… A woman lifting a baby, a black + white photo of the inside of a bar, a surreal scene of a man painting in the desert with a sun steer monolith thing in the background. Nothing deep + meaningful, but cool for sure. Towards the end felt like I was in that weird place between falling asleep and being awake. Although maybe I was."
"I saw moving patterns /colours, I wasn’t relaxed until close to the end. I feel I would have been more receptive. But I still enjoyed it and saw shapes and moving things almost like a dimension where shapes all move in different directions, in the middle of my sight was a black dot. I also saw Drake reach for me and had some influence over what I saw. I also saw people to my left reaching for me, my partner and a man. Saw spirals, dots, circles. Flying trapezes. "
"The colours were amazing. How does the mind do that?
Looking at so many different collections of colours - many making me think of relaxing places in nature, sunrise on a beach perhaps, waterfalls, space, then all of a sudden immersed in a clash of bright colours that calmed down and then disappeared into black. It would then start again, a swathe of calm coloured patterns and then sunshine appearing, getting warmer and warmer, then more splashes of red and blue interacting with each other. 
It was fascinating and I tried to link the different sounds with what I was seeing, but I could find no relativity at all."
"It was a kaleidoscopic experience. One might liken it to pixelation and the tracks of pixelation would run in different tracks as if moving in different directions. And then everything would stream into a tunnel focusing forward. Every now and again, the colour would be one wash of warmy bright orange or blobs of turquoise. Slowly fading out. Always moving, always changing. Line of bright ‘......’ like colours appearing + morphing into something else. And then paves of one soft tranquil colour. "
"Rising feeling
Floating over mounds - smooth ones
Visions of oil swirls slowly swirling
Arches
When lights faded it was like space but every star was a colour.
Midway I sense a feeling of exploring new colours. Nearly like I had never seen them. Or I was matching colours together you wouldn’t normally to blend new colours. 
Sense of release at the start and end. I vision good times with my ex. Going through a breakup that ended abruptly with no real reason was hard but matching this experience was a sense of release. The memories stay deep down - would like to try this just audio in 360 to explore my visual meditation practices. "
"30 - 45 mins
Deep calm
Imagined the sound-scape, as being on a train journey; at one point.
Calm, due to mindful techniques outlined and directed.
The Dreamachine was interesting in terms of its association with mindfulness and soundscape music. 
My experience was informed/enriched by the recent talk, by scientist Anil Seth, last night. "
"I see changing patterns develop and vanish each millisecond. Several meaningful shapes and images never have chance to persist.
I see tunnels, to planets and the space, changing, opening and closing at the same time. I see red, green, purple, yellow lines and squares. Flashing and compromising swirls, nets and bubbles broken up. 
I see a planet being cut in half and half again.
I see a man sitting on a chair, still, and I leave. 
I see circling, pivoting, twisting walls that never stands.
I feel flying and falling before awake. "
"The taster is a good idea because it made me feel a bit claustrophobic (in my own eyes!). But once you get used to it - and look downwards - it’s a totally alien experience. Like dying happy and then becoming conscious again. The music guides and coaxes your thoughts and your eyes can’t compute it at first - but then you start sinking in - and flying through the sky, or falling down through a fun wormhole.
Then chaos and geometrics takes over, sometimes blasting at you - and then you calm again and darkness - and awake. "
"I saw a lot of geometrical shapes, especially hexagons. Sometimes the images appeared in more layers, i.e like a layer of shapes (like crystals) turning around a group of other shapes.
At the end, I could not feel my body, except for the strong sensation that my partner was holding my hand (he was sitting next to me, but obviously he was not holding my hand).
And red scares me ( I saw it on its own most of the time).

The perfections of the shapes I have seen is far beyond my ability of rationally thinking about them or drawing them. It’s beyond me. "
"I did the deep listening. My mind was completely blank. I concentrated on my breathing exercise, as demonstrated in for 4, hold, for 4, out for 4, hold for 4.
I really enjoyed the build-up of sound and the constant, driving back beat. My absolute favourite part was when it got really loud with binaural beats. I felt I was alone in the galaxy but I wasn’t lonely. I was in awe of the experience.
When that died down and the music was on a very low level, I felt so relaxed but I wanted the really loud music to come back.
All in all, I enjoyed the experience and would definitely try it again. I have tried the visual one and feel it adds so much more to it, so if I had to pick, I’d prefer the visual experience."
"At the beginning I saw a yellow ball with a black dot in the middle. The yellow started to cover the black and the ball faded away. Then there was a light blue ball getting bigger and as it got “closer” it turned white, symbolising rebirth. In between these balls I seen orange waves moving in time with the music. I kept coming back to “reality” but once I focussed everything, like wavy orange lines jiggled about. The noise that sounds like an MRI machine was timed with the black dot becoming smaller and eventually being totally consumed by the yellow ball. I felt like I could breathe more deeply. "
"As the light came on, a feeling of light and space - dawning.
As light faded into blue/black darkness a feeling of night.
In between with the flashing lights in a square patterns mainly. 
Surprisingly many colours and in like far distance with some colours, an arched window with many panes, and a dark figure within the frame.
I was sorry to finish the session!"
"Almost too much to describe!
Great sense of warmth - absolutely loved hearing that great music in that environment.
Surprised by how much was seemingly appearing visibly. Ranging from blue skies to volcanic red.
Lots of things like circles + lines + so much colour.
A lovely experience - thanks so much!
It certainly triggered some memories in my head while still being totally immersed in the experience.
Felt very peaceful + comfortable even in the more intense moments. "
"I felt relaxed, initially I saw multiple stacked squares in neon colours coming towards me however it progressed into an octopus in purple colours floating around the sea, quickly moving on to body’s being ‘.....’ in thousands by a magnet and buildings in the distance. Red shapes appeared as well as an eye recurring sucking up all that was under it, beautiful vibrant neon colours. A snail pulling its tongue in and out briefly featured coming close to me. Beautiful purple colours. Other tile-like shapes appeared with intricate beautiful details. Blue under the sea experience as if I was in the sea alone with absolute peace.  Turtles occasionally swimming past. I was travelling through a tunnel of pastel colours sliding down one way then changing direction without warning. "
"At first the lights were so bright it felt a little overwhelming, there were pink and red colours moving like really not raindrops, as if I was moving really fast through space. As the dark came, I felt like I slowed down - and the raindrops of light evaporated, or exploded, and I saw stars, deep blue space. At times when the music was deeper, I saw waves, like I was underwater. Waves crashing over, white spray and deep dark blues. later , the stars returned and purple and red colours - like being in space. There were portals and accelerating through these, getting farther and farther. I remember feeling a bit overwhelmed, emotional like I wanted to cry. And then I felt stretched - like I was out of my body. As deeply as I breathed or as much as I focused on my feet on the very solid floor - I felt attached… but detached. Floating a little higher than myself. An amazing, powerful experience. "
"I found the experience as a mirror of how we behave as human beings.

A soft way to make us understand our truth, is our truth and not everyone’s.

A mirror to make us awake. To enrich our empathy.

We have to stop trying to convince others what we think is right."
"I did not feel relaxed at the beginning, but then I wanted to let go. I was thinking about how a blind person would feel, also was curious to see so I opened my eyes to see the light. The experience reminded me of a toy we had when we were children: a pipe to look through with colourful pieces of paper at the end and you move it to see different shapes. 

I felt I was moving when the light was flickering. I was tired of moving. I was thinking of ‘.......’ feeling this and how to do it. "
"Initial difficulty in switching off but after about 5 mins was really into the visuals. The colours were something I as an artist could never mix, violets and oranges, sparkly snowfalls, deep purples and reds. The end of the experience was very intense and I was able to completely switch off. The colour blue was very prevalent in various shades and at one stage. I thought I could see helicopter blades. 
Butterfly scales.
Although the music was ominous and slightly foreboding it inspired optimism and happiness. I haven't felt so relaxed and inspired for a very long time. More please. "
"I saw only in greyscale. With the exception of a central red spot. All of my patterns were the same except the movement varied. They all consisted of black, white, and grey arrows. There was a filter over my experience which was like a VHS tape being rewound (movement and grit).

I felt very interested and surprised. I have never had a visual experience before. I do not have visual imagery for my imagination or dreams (Aphantasia). I had thought that I would not respond to the Dreamachine.

I would like to learn more about how the Dreamachine works. 
Thank you for this opportunity. "
"I was unaware of my physical body or head. I was aware that I tried to ‘see’ the lights with my eyes through my closed lids. I could consciously draw back my intention to my mind/brain passively receiving the input (as opposed to my eyes seeking the input) and when I did this the colours came. When I saw through my eyeballs I saw shapes only. Then I felt in my brain I saw colours. I heard the blades of a helicopter - very distinctly - I don’t believe this wasn’t a deliberate noise inserted!
There was a good deal of symmetry

*missing 2nd page* "
"*missing 1st page*

Focused to planes either vertical or horizontal and not kaleidoscopic. I also was aware of a more ‘forward’ place sensation which seemed more like the white light on my retina, and distortions such as black ‘sleepers’/floaters. - I was able to fly between the two. I was so heavily occupied with the ‘association generation’ ‘......’. A lot of my imagery seemed futuristic recognised of ‘Tron’. Overall I lost time. I don’t dream in much imagery or colour.
But this experience produced very intense colours. Uch more intense than I could have thought possible. As I try to think of an image to try and reproduce I can’t get a ‘.......’ handle on one. I feel there was too much that I can’t lock in on one. I’m amazed at what happened. I feel my brain was in a free flow association mating ‘.........’ ‘.......’ all in attempts to process the novel sensory input. The music definitely influence the style and rate of creation. "
"The main sensation of colour was though I was seeing ‘new’ colours - that were a blend of two or three colours at once. Perhaps seeing layers of colours through each other. Aside from the strong patterns I felt a lot of movement and flowing pattern. The number of light pulses seemed to make a fizzing sensation especially as the intensity of brightness changed. My own feelings were lighted by the experience and I felt a strong sense of joy and calm even as the music intensified. There were so many different interactions and new patterns that I feel it better to write than draw - especially as the intensity of colour was astonishingly rich and defies my ability to reproduce visually. It brings to mind the time I felt the sun on my face on a train and experiencing the strength of colour and flicker from passing trees, building a pattern. I really liked the Visuals prompted by the crescendo at the end of the first ‘act’ in the slowing hammering of the music  really emphasised the near binary switching of intense colour. It was beautiful.

I thought of having a solar (direct light) version, which could have a shutter to cause the flickering - given how strong the sun is.

Blue magenta yellow in layers.
Initially tiny grid patterns that softened and blended. "
"It was great fun!
I was very aware of how relaxed I was throughout the experience. I had no idea what I was coming to; it was a complete surprise from my husband - I’d never heard of it before. I was a little apprehensive before starting - warnings about maybe wanting to ‘exit the experience’ etc. But the 5 min taster really reassured me.
It reminded me of being a child and driving along in the backseat of a car, and the effects that the sunlight has through the trees while driving along. I would shut my eyes and see shapes + colours. I was aware of my breathing throughout. I tried ‘looking around’ to see if the shapes + colours differed. If I closed my eyes harder the colours changed more from orange/yellow to purple. Not many of the shapes hard sharp edges. The taster was very orange/yellow. The main one had more white/black. The music was well harmonised to the lights. I desperately wanted to open my eyes to see the white light, but I didn’t as I didn’t want to spoil the illusions.
The main taster went surprisingly fast and I thought it must be about 10 mins long. It did go quickly!
The whole experience left me lying in my seat with a smile on my face feeling relaxed and reminiscing happy memories of my childhood.

Thank you!"
"The colours I loved, many of the shapes I did not. Perhaps I would feel differently doing it again, I would have more trust. There were times when I was comfortable to lose myself, wanting to go further in, other times I held on to me. I clung to some bend of control, were ‘......’ the desire to control.
I was aware of how much of myself I brought in with me, I felt like a lot today. The drive, accrued time + ‘.........’ coffee did not help. I had a range of how much I was carrying, much of it not wanted - having had some experience of reduced ego before. It seems that side of me is alive + kicking. So too is the side I prefer; just a little starved of love, trust, bravery maybe. The music + my want to interact with it seemed to help get me in a mood I would want to be in. 
As I write I’m aware of those in my periphery, I wonder what process they are engaged in now, and if they are ‘......’ ‘.......’, a ‘......’ of a frailty I do not wish to carry. "
"I saw axes spinning in both directions, I saw constant shifting, turning and togetherness coupled with solitude. It made (this made) me feel accepting of myself. Of kindness for myself when I worry my mind doesn’t focus or concentrate. There’s so much to focus on in the world. How could we possibly close the rest of it off to have a singular viewpoint and goal.

I saw shifting back and forward, like I was travelling in time, or space, or somewhere.

I saw the smallest creatures, what looked like tiny insects then I also saw an abyss. A massive wonderful unexplored abyss I felt wonder and calm. It made me think of the warmth and beauty we have around us. It enveloped my mind and body and I am grateful for it and the team today."
"I felt relaxed! At first a little apprehensive of what to expect, but found it quite beautiful, energising and creating peace.
I reflected on both my parents who have passed away and I knew they are with me and that I have a lot more to experience in life and I will be safe and happy.
I remember thinking that I was inside a crystal looking out and the brightness and clarity was wonderful. When some of the colours came I related them to diamonds and nature mostly. I saw patterns but the colours held my attention and focus. When the colours were bright yellow or orange I felt warmer, like the sun and when it went dark I felt cooler. "
"I felt great waves of joy, especially as the warm light rose up it almost felt like a new day rising. I felt like I was watching the passage of time. There were many layers and movement. I kept breaking out into a huge smile! It was really thrilling and also soothing. I felt perfectly at ease and felt the love, time, consideration and effort from the minds behind the project as well as the lovely staff really helped make it a really magical experience. It was like 2001 Space Odyssey! I felt deep personal joy and gratitude to take part and share this moment. It was as though I was feeling days and months past in an elemental primal way. Thank you guys so much for such a wonderful experience! So much joy + love. "
"See
Grids, bright colours, shapes, numbers, letters and a chair!
On the side of the kaleidoscope were scenes with people, cityscapes and landscapes in the centre always was a small circle with a face/or a moth or a dancing girl.
Very beautiful vivid colours, blues, green, pinks and reds.
Felt
Relaxed with a tingling in my abdomen + solar plexus, and my limbs felt light - and my feet and ankles cold. 

Think
Enjoyed the experience - initially trying to make sense of what I saw but then just relaxed into it - apologies done without my glasses. "
"At first, undefined blue and red alternated splodges flashing. When I thought of the colour green, green spots would appear. When I relaxed my gaze/focus, the colours started to spin in a spiral. When the lights went down, I saw sharper shapes and patterns appear for a split second - tessellated patterns like Islamic art. Fractal shapes/ mathematical and end even. Most of the time there was a centre to the visuals - round like my pupil. I could switch my focus from eye to eye or watch the patterns with both eyes. If I looked left or right to the edges of my vision, the colours were brighter. If I squinted my eyes together the patterns changed. "
"This morning I did the audio-only experience and this afternoon I did the full experience. I really enjoyed this morning, and loved the music. I felt very grounded afterwards. The audio visual experience, I found it tough to settle into it, it was as though there was too much going on. The visuals were a bit reminiscent of a mushroom trip, except that the experience seemed to be only of surface level - it didn’t have the depth of a psychedelic experience - it was as though I was looking at a cool light show. I do feel very warm now, and a little unsettled - hard to find the words to describe it. "
"Prevailing “out of body” feeling. Hard to remember distinct shapes or features. A man's face with warm red features bathed in light. An intermeshed web of pulsating, mute like cells + lines. A corridor of grey, white and black hexagons moving both forward and backwards simultaneously. A homogenous, pulsating swirl of blue + black that sped up until it broke. Total out of body, anti/over sensory feeling, forgetting where I was - like asleep but awake, in between able to move but ‘.......’ to not, sleep paralysis but content, was comfortable when returning. When being awoken from out of R.E.M. Asleep but transcending dreaming, unaware of how much I ‘......’ total talk of bodily awareness - might have been like to deliberate surrender of one-self to sounds."
"I was sceptical coming in as I don’t normally have a particularly visual brain. But when I started seeing the lights and patterns it was like my mind turned into a kaleidoscope. I was seeing all these patterns and colours that I wouldn’t normally see. At points it felt like I was in space seeing the stars and travelling through nebular and supernovas. Felt a little like being in the bifrost from Norse Mythology and seeing the stars with a swirling rainbow around me. I was blown away by the experience and it felt like I was there for a few seconds, not for the full length of time. It was astonishing - thank you. "
"I saw the night sky on a quick time lapse. Stars of the night sky rushing from horizon to horizon merging. At one point there were a thousand eyes watching me and blinking. Blue eyes. Geometric stars. Blurring across me that I have seen before somewhere. The intense light of yellow was like the beating down sun on the hottest of days. The sheer intensity makes my eyes water but unable to look away. In the quiet moments I seen a stream of blue like the currents of water in a river on the surface.
Seen a snow shower of the most perfect snowflakes falling from the sky."
"I saw lights and shapes that looked like from a kaleidoscope. The shapes were very symmetrical and had different colours but followed a pattern.
I saw a human shape with light all around it (white). Some blue sparkles came out and were all around this “person”. I have no idea who this “person” was. At the end I didn’t know if I was sleeping or not. "
"I mainly saw geometric shapes like this + repeated over and over and over again, mainly in red, black and white (think seven  nation army, the white stripes music vid). Then if I focused on my right side I saw a group of people walking towards me, flickering in black and white with stripes across either their faces or shirt. It was like looking through one of those old film tricks, which spins and you look through the slats on the side to see the images move. If I focused on the left side it was just one person in more detail, he popped in more than once, he was walking away from someone then turned back while he was walking, I sensed anger. The middle of my vision was the geometric shapes. And while my visuals changed throughout my experience that one which I described before, came up multiple times. The rest were mainly green, blue and yellow, geometric shapes. "
"Felt extreme anxiety at first and in fact think I missed a lot of the experience by concentrating on my breathing and keeping my heart rate down.
Relaxed a ‘......’ of the way through and began to cry although didn’t feel sad!
Somewhat anxious towards the end again.
Feel I would enjoy the experience better a second time - I doubt I would be as tense."
"I felt I was in a journey of time through moments of beautiful light in my life. From memories of childhood, loved ones, beautiful places.
It felt like time was continuous, infinite yet repeating. It felt like the spirit of humanity was always with us during those moments of both light and dark. The colours I saw evoked memories, memories of movements of love, beauty and goodness. "
"There was consistently a circle in the middle, it would change. Colour/size/intensity but it was always there. At the very end it turned into an eye. 

As a medititator I felt like I had control more, I felt like I was manipulating my consciousness; when my mind got distracted, the shapes/colours were less clear… when I re-focused everything became more refined + detailed."
"I saw red when the light was bright and after time a sort of centre formed, like a cell with a nucleus. Then I saw a series of curved diamond type shapes in lilac with green in the joins. There was almost always a lot of movement in a pattern of lights like roller coaster tracks moving left to right, right to left or up and down or diagonal. At times I saw what looked like a door or window in the middle of my field of vision. The pattern changed while the sound of the music and the experience/sights became closer and more immersive when I imagined/breathing through my eyebrow centre. Overall, it was very enjoyable. "
"I saw a universe being born in a womb like black void and I was walking toward it. I saw lots of colours, oranges, yellows, indigos. Triangles split into a thousand eyes/lightning and lava clouds coated down by kaleidoscope skis, abstract clouds and ships sailing across seas. Sunflowers burst open whenever I needed a breath or the lights reset. It was incredible. I was lost. "
"It was really rewarding to have just the music to experience (I have done the High Sensory experience before). It has a power and impact of its own, and took me on a rich and peaceful journey. I felt relaxed and engaged, but my brain still related the experience to a range of dream-like images from other aspects of my life (not DM-generated). Very glad to have experienced it like this."
"I could feel my breath and blood pumping through the veins matching the beats of the music. Having said that, when the beats got faster, I was calmly in sync with it. The music made me feel that I was being transported in the air in deep dark sky and space with northern lights and stars appearing. I haven’t seen the northern lights but whenever I do the feeling I felt today will come back in my memory.
My anxious mind time to calm down but once it did my mind brought back the beautiful scenes of the Scottish landscape I have seen while in my cycling trips. This is indeed one in the lifetime experience and in future whenever I will feel anxious and restless I will try to bring back the feeling I felt today in the ‘deep listening’ room. Thank you!"
"Very calm + peaceful. At times, like floating through space. At other times like being inside a kaleidoscope (sp?). Sometimes the images were graphic + regular, sometimes like cartoons, hand - drawn. Some of the colours seemed more bright, more intense, than I’d ever seen. Occasionally I felt that an object was taking shape but was just out of reach, it wouldn’t solidify. 
During the taster session, tears rolled down my face, although I wasn’t upset. It was the beauty of it I think.
Like a firework display in the mind 
A star show
Swimming in light + colour."
"The lights made me go inside my mind, walking through tunnels and then suddenly coming out in the sunshine. It brought images one sees under the microscope or seeing sky through forest companies. ‘......’ through the kaleidoscopic images created by my brain, I realised how complex my grey matter can be, we don’t just see light, we sense it, we feel it. Fabulous experience! "
"I must add to my previous comments that the I found deep listening as a mixture of sounds, sounds one hears in the nature, in everyday things around us. It was not music, just sounds. In the first few mins of the show those sounds transported me to beautiful temples as it reminded me of temple bells, it brought me peace. I am not religious but more spiritual and the concentration of the sounds brought in calmness. "
"A kaleidoscope of colours that cannot be organised, controlled, or made sense of. No units can be forged. A sense of impatience and frustration at not being able to take control of the experience. A realisation that deep meditation or relaxation cannot be achieved. 

Nostalgia; remembering childhood kaleidoscopes at grandparents' home. An attempt at cutting that distraction short.  "
"I felt so much more this second time. The consistency and the learned experience allowed for that I think. I felt entirely overcome and I don’t think I noticed the lights so much as before. My mind was wandering and I let it. I know I would always be let back in. My body was entirely relaxed and I felt at total peace in the moment. I felt ready to arrive and ready to leave. I felt emotions of forgiveness, joy, comfort, being loved. I thought of the really important and prevalent people in my life. I felt their protection and love. I made decisions for the future and their place in my life. Once again I felt confident and in control. In total control of myself and my decisions."
"Spinning circles clockwise in different colours, then I would be sucked into, then bright lines would come out, or stars around the edge.
At one point, lots of squares or + this shape joined up, or chains of lilac + white, and green + orange linking up with the spinning circles.
I could see dark long leafy shapes and branches but they disappeared when I focused on them. 
I like how everyone had similar experiences but all unique as well. "
"Along with lots of geometrics, I saw a lot of silhouettes of trees and mushrooms. They would grow so big and another would appear very small. 

It made me feel like I was floating around being drawn in a void for a while and being drawn into a focal point. 

Towards the end it made me think of times with friends long ago, it made me happy, thinking of this and my visuals became more intense because of it. "
"Pulsing patterns followed by periods of block colour. The pulsing was intense and anxiety inducing - so much movement, hard to grasp what, was seeing. Often squares shooting out or lining up grids. The lack of movement made me feel relief but when the experience was over my body was tense as if I’d been doing exercise. "
"Kaleidoscope patterns, hallucinogenic colour, vivid, almost hurting then calming into peace.
Colours I wouldn’t normally imagine. But a lot of warm bathing orange I loved how the music changed and the feeling and the speed of the light changed. At times it felt nerve inducing. I wanted to control the colours but I couldn’t, things I didn’t like then others I did. It all stimulated the senses like elastic pulses.
A rhythm not my won.
I’d like to try again
With someone holding my hand. "
"Having been very nervous this might trigger a PTSD experience from many years ago, I relaxed into the experience and felt transported. Becalmed, but also moments of the experience of sound and rhythm of the light patterns gave the impression of time transcending, floating, travelling at speed or light through space, and at various points emerging into different landscapes - deserts, the universe, the deep of the sea, the sun bursting through. I felt like I transcended my body and met some kind of higher presence in a sort of limbo/paradise. Dante-esque."
"I was in searing desert suns, time-warping down black holes, taking off on run-ways and total darkness. But what I found strangest was that it was all 70’s colours. The patterns on London tube seats. The orange and mustard contrast, the psychedelic spinning. 70’s. (I’m not into the 70’s. So this isn’t a previous predilection!). I was clubbing. I was reaching out. I was not in control but if I wanted to change the pattern, I just moved my eyes. My mind shouted THIS IS LIFE… SURRENDER.

I feel like I’ve touched base with my elemental self. Thank you… "
"I kept thinking - I should close my eyes! - My brain was trying to tell me I was watching something. I felt like my feet were floating and my body was lighter.
All my visions were red and yellow and oranges until near the end - purple showed up - all very subtle shapes no hard lines - and a meteor effect near the end.

I was amazed at what my mind was conjuring and had to keep reminding myself that my mind was doing this. "
"I felt like I was going on a journey through space and also time? I also felt sure I was experiencing what it’s like to move through the internet. It was a lot of geometric shapes like a kaleidoscope but very fast moving like I was travelling at the speed of light. It was overwhelming at times but I was never uncomfortable and I didn’t want the experience to end! I felt very at ease and happy. It felt a lot shorter than the time allotted. It was like a psychedelic trip without. The drugs, wish I could have one in my house!
I will be recommending this wholeheartedly to anyone with ears. "
"In the beginning vivid geometric twisting shapes. Changing colours swirling within each other to form moving images. Some images start becoming more sharp, but always just out of focus.
After a while my awareness of the sounds and images faded, mind wandering through incoherent thoughts. Towards the end focus returned, but images remained unsharp and fleeting. Emerged from the experience relaxed."
"It was difficult to listen to the music with the lights, but it was still a very pleasant experience. It was as though the lights were a symphony on their own separate to the music. "
"At times I was very very tense, my jaw was shut tight, my back and body were clenched and I felt very very anxious. However after my eyes got used to it I found it a really peaceful and calming experience. I kept seeing dragonflies over and over again over a blue and green lake, which totally relaxed me and I actually found it went quick. I would love to try this experience again now knowing how relaxing it is. When it finished my body felt  heavy and totally loose. I work very stressful job, which I came straight from today, and I have never unwinded so quickly before. "
"It was brilliant - peaceful, but not. I saw shapes, lines, flashes of colour, and found myself smiling throughout. It made me happy, and it made me want to dance or more.

The shapes were sometimes hexagonal and sometimes spiky. There were vision-like explosions, other times it seemed like it was coming towards me or away from me.

I saw a lot of purple, red, blue, + green. The music made the feel like it was - whole body takeover, and I sometimes brought myself back on purpose, but if I was in again I would resist that!"
"It felt like I was travelling through time and space surrounded/inside a tunnel of more psychedelic colours. Constantly being propelled forward. Then the stillness like the sun shining upon me and everything was warm, calm and peaceful before slowly setting off again through space. At the end it felt like I’d arrived deep in the ocean. It felt like Atlantis. It was blue with sparkles like the universe but it felt deep and peaceful and magical and I was looking up towards the surface and reflections and ripples. A lot of the time a hexagonal ‘......’ kept appearing over me like a beehive. So much! What a truly intense beautiful experience!
Thank you."
"A kaleidoscopic experience, started with beautiful fractal shapes of different colours. Blues and greens the sharp edges then started to become softer. Like cells the whole experience then became euphoric especially when I discovered that I could change the shapes from sharp to soft.
Thank you Dreamachine."
"The ever changing configurations of colours, shapes, patterns and movement (inwards, outwards, spinning clockwise and anti-clockwise, panning, zooming, etc.) The flashing lights would give way to a slower peaceful experience of warm light that would soothe and encompass me. I saw light tunnels ahead of me I could never travel towards. The speed of movement would increase giving an impression of travelling in space through black holes in time/speed of light. "
"Shadows of the past memories flooding in - I am the Dreamachine. A moment in time, followed by another moment and another.
Reborn as if in a new dawn. Mornings after the intensity of the darkness of night. Stillness as the end approached, my words influencing my experience tied up with experiences past, present, perhaps the illusia of future.
Sounds becoming music as patterns are formed.
Feelings of disturbance, calm of anxiety and yet gentle soothing of the soul being caressed, held.
Don’t male sense - immersed in the flow through time and space. "
"Amazing!! - Lots of Psychedelic colours/shapes, hearts, squares, circles, squares, lines, vertical, horizontal. Felt a few times if I was like an astronaut floating in space and also being drawn into the night sky + universe.
Another time it was as if I was under the sea with beautiful coral, reefs and fish + dolphins swimming ahead of me. At times I felt like the sun was shining down on me + I felt happy + content and smiling. I also felt my right thigh pulsing a few times. Such a wonderful experience. 
Thanks. "
"I began by seeing very simple blankets of bright vibrant orange. Each flashing experience was a different combination of white and another colour; first green, then pink, then blue. After a while the patterns became less geometric and more organic and sinuous and started to include images of different animals including a tortoise, tiger and some sort of reptile + animal footprints. 

At first the flashing images were really overwhelming but they eventually became more of a background to the music .

The dark intervals were like swirling clouds of black, grey and deep blue. "
"Spiralling tunnels of light, drawing you in and spinning you out?
Vibrant colours, strange combinations
Brilliant blue, warming enveloping orange,
Comforting purple.
Cobwebs of light drawing you forward.
Too many changing patterns and shapes to recall, streaming light colours and shapes total relaxation and thought free experience. "
"I saw so many different shapes and colours. Squares, circles, stars, hexagons - these were constantly moving and changing colour. Sometimes the colours were beautiful and bright. Others, they were dark and deep. Sometimes the shapes would morph into things. I saw a lot of animals, faces and bodies. At one point it felt as though I was watching the universe, galaxies were tumbling and my ‘......’ kept zooming out. Seeing more and more galaxies, suns, moons. There was one moment of seeing people but they were built from dots, then they started to spin and blend together. I had one euphoric experience, the light became very strong and bright, my body felt a rush of adrenaline. "
"At certain points, the lines I saw resembled spiderwebs and were moving so quickly it made me feel anxious. It felt like a nice relief when the black and white flashing turned into a deep, wavy purple, which made me feel relaxed again. I struggled to keep my eyes fully shut - I often saw the people in the chairs (involuntarily) I saw a lot of different patterns and textures including stars and tunnels. At times it felt like I was spinning or falling.
Like a sky full of stars.
I saw an eye a few times which was the only ‘distinct’ clear thing that I saw. Some of the colours were so bright - it was really weird, a little overwhelming. "
"Large, small, green in blue, waves, buildings, receding, memories, homes, streets, ruins, people, shadows, shapes - yellow/sand. Coming and going (me) ‘.......’, drifting, re-engaging, okay to be me. Scanning, welcoming, opening, watching. Institute, bold, pulsating - vivid changing colours shape, sizes directions - flow across in/out, done.
After images, columns. Shapes.

I came two days ago. Unaware of emotional effect until I heard the music again when starting the perception survey - and was moved by the memory.
Wishing my daughter will make it here too…
"
"At first I felt a bit scared to let go. Then I just went with the colours and movement. I could see the colours but just beyond them somewhere I could see textures - surfaces with different bumps and ‘.......’ on them.

Sometimes I felt as if I was moving through space, going towards a vortex, then it felt as if I had arrived somewhere, with machinery making a noise and then I came back to a quieter place.
Now I feel very relaxed. I can’t stop yawning."
"Lots of visual artefacts. It reminded me of both geometric and organic shapes.

Organic shapes were more subtle, often slower and intricate in the dark, akin to a swirling galaxy, organic fibonacci reaction diffusion patterns. Often blues.

Geometric shapes like prisms, triangles, diamonds and patterns that reminded me of optical diffraction lensing. Often reds and whites. 

At one point I experienced a strong sensation of motion (although had periodic subtle tunnelling motion) and dissociation with arms/hands not unlike the effects of ketamine."
"Lots of vibrant psychedelic colours forming fast - moving largely geometric shapes
Calm periods of intense dark peacock blue greens
Yellow pastel clouds edged in mauve
3D impressions of moving into/out of a hole/tunnel
Feelings of anxiety when music and movement intense
Feelings of ‘butterflies’ warm, fluttery and intensely pleasant towards the end as the music calmed
Drifted out of consciousness at times
Saw few shapes that made sense but a hippo with long eyelashes, and a human nose and mouth, even a shadow of a face appeared over the course of the experience. "
"I saw many things. Asteroids, cauliflowers, lion’s mane, valleys, little stars. It was more cinematic than emotionally involved or close. There was no narrative arc or story, it was episodic, thematic, with tone and texture and mood that the music enhanced. Towards the end. I experienced what I thought was audio/visual synesthesia, but the lights may have been synced with the music.
I felt the distance it created, without any mind-bending effects, could be useful for grasping underlying tone, texture, and mood in everyday life."
"Orange light - contentment and warmth
Rounded moving shapes - like travelling through vortex space travel. Cloud changing perspective convex
Eye compression about to control colour a little
Intense flashing - pinpricks - eyes and jumping body - had to cover once, too intense
Both fractals with blockiness + swirling patterns separately
Intense happiness + emotion to feel so creative overwhelmed."
"At the very beginning, I felt not used to those flashing lights and a little bit overwhelmed by them. Nervous and forget how to breathe. But fortunately I began to see many scenes which I enjoyed a lot (not quite sure if joyable). I was just curious if the images were from my imagination or because of the white light. Or maybe I’ve fallen asleep and all were dreams! Anyway, I feel relaxed now. 
Thank you."
"For the most of the time I experience a fast spinning kaleidoscope, mainly made up of blue and red colours.

I find it easier to picture thought. Then when I had the slightest thought of an image or a person. It appeared vividly.

Towards the end of the experience. I experienced a radiating to rectangle of spectrums, starting from a white dot at the centre of my sight.  "
"Different colours at first it went very dark then the shapes started with colours I could see the movement with the music in mind. My mind did keep drifting but when I went back to my breathing and relaxed more the colours get deeper + brighter.
I felt it was over too quick and would have enjoyed an extra half hour. 
The seats felt a bit weird at the start my back was comfortable enough. But once I started to be present and connect with my breath I was able to relax better.
Felt it was over too soon as I was just getting into it. "
"I kept my eyes open during this experience. I saw the shape containing the colours as a cat's eye or a sunset/sunrise.
I found the crescendo of music and intensity of a machine a little agitating and felt tension in my right arm as the sound intensified.
I enjoyed the soft pastel colours and vibrant orange and reds as energising. "
"Felt like being on a beach or somewhere peaceful on a bright summer's day. Light felt utterly natural. The immersion into dark was intense followed by scintillation, fractal patterns, colour, geometric shapes… Constantly in motion….
At one point there was a distant white focal point with a few “stars” (bright points of light) and then this exploded into a billion. 
Stars - like looking at a deep field image of space in 3D (i.e from within it somehow).
Particularly enjoyed when could focus/defocus enough to observe fractal, strict geometrical forms in electric blue or green.
A great experience - amazed by how well it works: or is it how amazing our brains are?? Hatta
Thanks"
"In the brightest fastest light just not long before the end. I saw a circle of yellow and black moving fast surrounded by square patterns of yellow and black. 

Near the beginning in the dark times I saw blobs of colour similar to those I have previously experienced in meditation sessions for kundalini yoga etc.

In the light times near the beginning I saw moving shapes. Often some light red and some light blue often in the context of dreams like moving figures and objects."
"A lot of red and green colours. Mostly in the form of lines and X’s.

Constantly saw a black moving swirl in the middle of my focus point.

I felt calm during most of the experience. However there were points that I felt panic and had to open my eyes when it went dark again to be aware of my surroundings. 
P.s - I have previously struggled with anxiety."
"Close to spiritual, for a very non-spiritual person!
Felt myself reaching out to catch things.
Moments of heightened tension but always wanting to see what was coming next
Felt connected to the universe, like witnessing the big bang.
Stirring emotions, wonder, awe, low-level fear, euphoria, peace, sadness, appreciation, escape both from + to 
Journey that I was both in control of and constantly surprised by."
"I relaxed my thinking and I closed my eyes. I didn’t remember exactly all image. Although I feel in contact with myself. 
I remember all light and many colours, blue, whites, yellows, pinks and 1 blue eye in the middle of my picture. I think that I slept.
I am connected with my mind and I have feel good well being.

Thank you for amazing experience!
P.s sorry for my english! "
"I seen a lot of different patterns and shapes, chequered patterns mostly with colour combinations of red and white of black and white. Also seen shapes like hearts in dancing motions, extremely colourful. I also seen shapes of animals and brief flashes of outlines of mythical creatures like mermaids. Towards the end of the experience I saw what looked like a galaxy, with a bright flash coming from the left and different coloured planets to the right, which were all moving among each other. The experience made me feel like I was getting a snippet of the creative side of my brain which I don’t use much in daily life. Overall I felt extremely relaxed and immersed in what I was seeing.  "
"I felt like my ears and body became a sound to light generator, capable of making every sound into a pattern of light inside my mind. Every part of the music opened up new pathways to discover and explore. It felt incredibly connected, a space like ‘.....’ love else I’ve ever been. I felt the most overwhelming sense of euphoria when the bass first opened up. Tears started streaming down both cheeks on my face and I couldn’t stop smiling uncontrollably. They were the ultimate tears of joy. I thought of my dad and how much I miss him.  "
"More expansive consciousness , different shapes and colours. My sense of self expanded and it felt infinite. Mild nausea. I had to concentrate to stay in the experience. But also let my mind relax. In the process. It was a combination of staying relaxed and concentrating that allowed me to enter ‘.......’ in the experience. My everyday world felt extremely small and restrained compared to this. It was like looking into the edge of an abyss on other dimension. "
"Initially put off by girl next to me coughing a lot… made me anxious about covid - wanted her to voluntarily leave as distracting others from full experience… Then felt angry that she was still coughing away and wanted her to be asked to leave. Eventually it stopped. Wonder if you should have policy around this - as didn’t make me feel safe. Once in the experience - found it mostly beautiful, relaxing kaleidoscope of colours and shapes… Towards the very end saw more literal things - a bird’s eye view of a road leading to a village - a couple resting against a grave… a heart… the v. intense flickering sometimes made me feel someone was in my face - but rode it out, back to bliss and vibrant colours. On leaving feel like I do after meditation or hypnotherapy. Relaxed and opened."
"My experience with the Dreamchine was very soothing, relaxing and quite personal. During the start I struggled to keep the breathing technique going. Once the teaser was over I readjusted myself to become more comfortable. I then started breathing to the tempo of the music. Then the patterns started. I have 3 vivid pictures in my head coming out of the machine. The first was the silhouette of a tiger/lion head. About half way through I got this overwhelming cube illusion containing about 30 rings. Finally towards the end I got this amazing picture of a grand Oak Tree. This is one of the most strange but mind opening experience of my life. Thank you. "
I felt a lot of different things throughout the experience. I felt at one point like. I was soaring through the sky pressing different parts of the world with a lot of very tall buildings. Then it was like I was looking through a kaleidoscope with many different colours. I felt like I was surrounded by water but in an enormous swimming pool with no bottom or sides just masses of mosaic tiles. The main colour I could see was red in the centre then just every shade of blue while I felt like I was in water.
"It was my second experience as I did it 2 weeks ago. Felt less spiritual, emotional but still kaleidoscope colours were incredible. Sometimes still, sometimes pulsating, bulging, spiralling out of control. At times I felt happy. At times with sense of panic when the shapes and colours were spiralling - I tried to ‘let go’ and experience, really try to be at peace.
It was great to be at peace. It was great to disconnect from the body, just see and experience. Still difficult to stop my body from thinking and analysing.
Lots of red, orange and blue. I’ve seen tiny bit of green. No specific shapes (maybe eye and triangle at times) but generally abstract movement of shapes and colours. "
"It felt very kaleidoscopic visual. Initially it was mostly 2 tone - Red and blue, random shapes and then it got very varied in shape + colour - although mostly 2 tone colour. Surprised how my mind was able to wonder back to day 2 day concerns even amongst crazy visual stimulation. At one point pulsing felt like my eyes were being tapped lightly.

Was able to direct my attention a few times but didn’t make colour green. 

Very interesting experience, glad I came. "
"The music was very helpful in intensifying the feelings of the experience.
At first the speed of the chequered red and white landscape zooming past my head was threatening, scary and made me dizzy. I cringed back from it and didn’t like the lack of control. When the squares slowed down, I felt better and could enjoy it. I saw a huge number of colours. Sometimes I saw what looked like stars, and other geometric shapes. In the end it was making me smile, I felt some euphoria.
It ended too soon! I was just getting into it. "
"Lots of lines/shapes/colours - moving in/out, back and forth.
Felt relaxed at first but felt my breathing quicken with the speed of the flashing lights. Had to remind myself of the breath in, breath out to calm myself.
Felt I was reacting - my breathing, heart beat to the pace of the lights. At times, the bright lights were blinding - as if I had my eyes open yet they were closed! 
Almost wanted to put my hands to cover my eyes from the flashing lights - as if they were coming from a fast approaching car - I felt scared, uneasy, uncomfortable. My attention to my breathing. 

*missing second page*"
"I saw beautiful cream-coloured horses with flowing manes as they galloped through a forest in bright sunlight and as they moved through the day, into twilight and eventually darkness. The sun shining through the trees was amazingly bright and it brought out the colours of the leaves. At one shape, a train thundered by - this was a really long train and it took quite a while for it to pass by. The horses continued on their journey, crossing a river which was full of multi-coloured fish. They swam in the same direction and their colours were amazing! The horses stopped to drink from this river and then continued on their journey……"
"It was a lot more 3 dimensional and textured than I was imagining. There were some very strong directional and rotational movements.

Towards the end my brain started to add the occasional human figure. I expect if I sat there longer, I would start to perceive a bit more concrete objects. 

I expect this is a little like a low resolution DMT experience at the height of the trip minus the psychological effects."
"At first, I seen lots of shapes. Probably every type of shape I’ve ever seen. I seen one colour lead into the next. White into green, into blue, vivid, red, purple, yellow, gold. I was travelling fast through the universe in the centre of a light orb. I seen trillions of stars through the gaps and ahead of me what seemed like an angel guiding me with light pulsing out of it. I was travelling fast and could see stars above and below fly past. I seen symbols in the rocks and what looked like the Nazca lines in the shape of animals. I seen a side profile of a face in pink/purple. It felt like a kaleidoscopic flower with colour at the centre and one thing/image connected to the next. I seen figures in the white light. I felt total peace and comfort. It felt like I slipped into a dream. My last image was of an older woman. I think I was talking to her but she was gone when the Guardian spoke again."
"Initially it felt like walking into ET and Austin Powers’ cannabis grow room, with an odd tension that juxtaposed the spa like serene whispers and music. As the experience began, bright sheets of light entered and fully consumed my field of vision before breaking into ethereal and amorphous fractal patterns. It felt like being constantly pulled through a spinning tunnel of textured light - at times violently speedy and sharp with red light and textures; at times broken by smooth silver grey walls - these were both textureless but also constantly in motion and giving the impression of journeys for distances. As lights dimmed, phosphene fractals emerged like crystalline blue-green geometric patterns like a b-movie hyperspace warp into space. It felt both restful and disorientating as the mind searched for ‘meaning’ and lost that search and was pulled into differently textured 3d vortexes which are difficult to describe in words. "
"The strong light was totally soothing and calming like the meaning of the world. Obvious in all its meaning.
I had so well those snakes sliding fast like pausing rollercoaster.
I was flying above purple smooth mountains for + short time.
Sometimes forgetting to break and having to reminding me of it.

Some sequences were really working for me but were too short to really feel the benefit of it.

Like a teaser of something I would like to try more often - contact me if you can to eric.toulouze@lilo.org."
"This experience was for me fully meditative. I first reached a state of complete relaxation of the body, followed by lightness. I felt my arms, my legs, my tummy, all of me, very light.
After that I started seeing myself as a child. I saw myself now talking and hugging myself of around 4-5 years old. That was emotionally really powerful, because I mange to use words of love with myself. Around the end I visualise myself in 10 years time talking to me now.
The whole experience was of introspection and of trying to get close to my inner child. Very emotional.  "
"The whole experience was intensely psychedelic and abstract, and so words can hardly do it justice…

BUT the feeling it left me with was a comforting clarity. By the end I saw that, in so many ways, the only person holding me back is me. My girlfriend told me the same earlier on, but in that moment I took it as a rebuke. Something about this experience allowed the love behind her words sink in.
I was left with this message: ‘Forgiveness is not about others. Ultimately, it’s for yourself. Stop living in the past, and start living now.’"
"Mainly pink, purple and red colours that blinded. Sometimes blobs, sometimes like water ripples. There were a few occasions when there were no colours - no visual - just blackness. It wasn’t like a just close your eyes and blackness, it felt heavy and for a split second the first time it happened, it felt strange, almost like an anxious feeling that the colour had left. Then the other occasions it happened it felt okay. Overall CONTINUE"
The music became very visual as I listened. The visuals developed into shapes and colours in my mind before sparking memories that felt really visceral as I say there. These memories were safe and gentle in how they appeared and I felt incredibly calm as I watched them unfold in my mind's eye. I also thought about my people. As the music built to quite a loud ‘.....’ it brought to my mind my children. Again this felt calm and safe and gentle but all the same surprising to me that it was at that point they came to mind. I found the whole experience very calming and a different but equally welcome approach to meditation. The music helped keep my focus on the present and while thoughts still came and went it was easy to let them pass without any judgement! 
"At the beginning I felt warmth and could see the sun. As I gradually began to relax into it I seen images of my childhood, when I spent many days at the beach with my mother and father. I felt at one point the floor lifting and it did not startle me as I felt safe and warm. Near the end of the experience I seen flashing white lights like an unknown source coming towards me, I again did not feel scared but safe and protected. Overall this was a beautiful experience. 
Thank you
Sleep well. "
"I thought everything would be amorphous shapes but was surprised by how geometrical my patterns were.

I became very aware that what I think of as “me” sat just behind my left eye.

I was unhappy by how much the experience was driven by the pulse and timbre of the music. 

I found it very enjoyable but not profound.

I wonder how much the experience would change given different music or constant pulse of light.

I found by the end that I was taking control of what I was seeing. "
"I saw patterns of nature at first, leaves, flowers, oranges. Repeating familiar natural pattern and images. Constant changing geometric patterns which shifted and interrelated as if travelling through dimensions. I am not religious but I saw Jesus on a cross floating in front of a snow mountain scene. I found my conscious mind focusing on a tangible images then this got in the way of the natural progression of the experience. Kaleidoscope ‘.....’ ‘.....’ me through. I saw a lot of Red, orange, yellow. When I recycled control, thought or analysis I fell deeper into the experience and allowed myself to be taken through the journey more intensely."
"Red + Blue kaleidoscope 4 sections moving away, then moving towards me colours change. Pattern turns to white moving from right to left.

Feeling of being underwater with the sun coming through.

Patterns, waves, pulses, changing colours, direction and speed.

Changes seemed to coincide with changes of music more than light.

Blues and greens, whites + pale green.
Red and blue, purple + turquoise
When dark. "
"Vivid bright colours
Reds pinks purples oranged yellow
Kaleidoscope experience
spinning/rotating in all directions
Honeycomb shapes
Roses
bats/bat’s eyes
Slight sickness feeling with motion
Diamond shapes 
Moving tunnels in different colours but mainly diamond shapes."
"Dreamachine is a good title. Not sure if I was awake or asleep at the end - no idea how long I was ‘in’ there for + felt an intense feeling of wellbeing at the end. What did I see? Colours, stars, tartan (?), kaleidoscope patterns, some looked like people, sometimes it felt like going into space… inner space rather than outer space. "
"I initially thought of a normal day. Being out in a field in the sun, everything was calm and the colours were changing and pleasant and my mind drifted. Then at one point it felt like a disturbance was coming (like the sound of helicopters and far off bombing) and it made me think about the war and all these people whose normal lives were upturned and devasted by forces beyond their control and how scary that would be. Then towards the end things sounded like they were settling down and there was some hope and positivity and I pictured people going through the rubble. And salvaging things with positive attitudes and making dark humoured jokes. I remembered a quote that a filmmaker said where if you create a story with people that just all sadness you’ve fundamentally failed to understand people. There's always positivity and humour even in the darkest places. "
"I felt as though I had been cast off into a vast unknown space filled with fractal patterns.
I experienced a sense of gyroscopic movement as though I was rotating pointedly and at times accelerating then slowing down. I felt egoless far brief moments (reminded me slightly of some experiences with drugs).
I saw a huge array of colours and shapes in a wide array of movements like spinning horizontal/vertical, and some shapes increased and decreased in size. "
"I great sense of wonder and relaxation. Wishing I could travel more through these images. Geometric chequerboards of red and blue pulsating and changing in an impossible way, faster than I could comprehend. Not overwhelming at all, just fascinating and amazing. Sweeps of pink and orange glowing, growing and enveloping as if travelling forward. I felt warm and embraced. Wonderful soundscape of music supporting any wave of positivity. "
"I felt absolutely at peace with the world - something I’ve not felt for some time. Vivid and moved colours, intertwining swirling around me and racing me on a journey to… where?
I felt love and warmth; a sense of belonging and a feeling of overwhelming calm.
Purples and reds, giving way to subtle greens and blues; interspersed with flashes and streaks of the purest, most brilliant white light which left me feeling powerful and strong.
I imagined departed loved ones and felt re-connected to them.
Now, as I write, I feel as one with the word + with life. "
"I saw endless corridors, lined with shamrocks that pulsed and spinned with purple light.
I saw shapes morph into things but centred around a cross, and they took the forms of a spinning sea god who was on top of the waves.
I couldn’t feel my arms and felt like I felt in sleep paralysis but it wasn’t unpleasant. I saw reams of newspaper print and felt I was watching headlines of events and in the background I felt those events. "
"The flashing initially felt uncomfortable, and I found myself deliberately trying to distract myself with thoughts about work and other memories of today. Once I allowed myself to feel safe in the discomfort I began to notice shapes - leaves, trees? Forest vibes. At one point I saw a figure with a backpack walking away from me. I also, very strangely, saw a man resembling Harry Hill at one stage!! Briefly, but he was there… 
The dark, thick glasses were the main notable feature. Sunlight and warmth (tangible warmth) felt in the beginning + ending. I also at some stages forgot to breathe - perhaps a sign of when I was most in *star sign* in + the experience.
The most calm I felt was when a pattern of green dots appeared. "
"Lines/ geometric shapes/numbers/colours .
An explosion of chaos + colour like a mix of star trek meets Dr WHo time warping.
Very linear patterns. 
A sense of the ocean.
Mostly red, especially reed at the start but this changed as the experience progressed with more yellows, oranges, blues + greens.
Hitting warp speed just about sums it up.

Felt my eyes moving a lot, almost uncomfortably so.
I also felt like I was forgetting to breathe and had to consciously take a breath!"
"I felt like I was in a magical fairground. It was like LA in a kaleidoscope. I felt multiple levels and swirling lights turning clockwise, and anticlockwise. I felt like I was in space, floating and swimming in a sea of lights and colours. I thought the person next to me was singing or chanting at one point it was a huge humm. It was very intense experience, similar to when I have taken LSD in my youth. It felt like a magic fairground ride, or like I was in my own video game. "
I started hurt by the intensity of an orange colour. This faded to cross lattices of greys with the sensation of the rising sun to the left. This resolved to a full horizon and then I started to pick out intense yellow spots followed by incredible purple/blue lozenges and diamonds. I drifted off a little and when I came back the colours and patterns were incredibly intense. Swirling/crossing multicoloured. Sometimes a circle of pattern with an outer space going round in a circle beyond. This became two crossed patterns going in opposite directions - one behind the other like a kaleidoscope but superimposed onto one another. A very intense experience and then slowly drifted back to plain light colours and simple shapes like ripples in water in less intense purple/grey colours.
"When I first started the experience I didn’t know what to expect. When I closed my eyes I felt relaxed and excited. I first saw the sun rising above the horizon on what looked like a savannah. The light quickly turned to a myriad of patterns, some hexagonal, some rhombus, all different shapes and colours. I saw stars, both like this; *star shape* and like this ::::... My favourite part was when I felt like I was falling through the stars in the night sky. I also saw what looked like an ancient nation with symmetrical pillars, and I felt like I was falling through an ancient Grecian palace. I saw windows from floor to ceiling and white pillars. Another favourite was the little pink elephants I saw walking in hexagonal shapes.
I felt quite amazed at what my brain can do and I really enjoyed my experience."
"Sometimes it was like a static television channel that would travel me to different spaces through circular time warps that were full of colour. I was touched by a darker moment, with a purple piece of land that had a hole in it, and this hole crumbled to get bigger and bigger. Until the purple land was gone. At one point I saw a face, maybe my face, in bright yellow and red and I went inside my face. Travelled into it, into my molecules, my pores, my everything.
I looked at the galaxy from afar.
I basked in the sun.
I cried a single tear of euphoria (?) nostalgia (?) sadness?
It was an experience I didn’t want to end.
But I should add I saw an explosion of colour that seemed like the end of something - a place, a thought, an existence.
It was moving, literally and figuratively. "
"Initially it seemed that a person to my left was being escorted away. Then dozens of people (one at a time) sat down either side of me (noticeable within my peripheral vision - it seemed). Then my hand pose (clasped hands on my chest) wasmirrored to my right but in a striking red. Then more people sat down either side of me. The people tended to sit into each other similar to a russian doll effect, the person shrinking as they sat. It seemed to be a man of a heroic army pose to my right and a bearded viking  man initially to my left replaced by a fisherwoman of sorts. Ahead of me a woman was sat down, plaited hair, reading a book."
"There are no words! Disorientating, dream-like, a sense of calm washing over me. At times I felt outside of my body, and wouldn’t have been surprised if I had started levitating. So much texture and colour. At one point it felt like I’d been swallowed by the sun, galaxies passing overhead, vortexes and kaleidoscopes. No sense of time - simultaneously slowing down, stopping, speeding up: WILD!"
"Feeling of motion, moving through a tunnel, constant moving forwards. Some visions - family, an ostrich! CHanging from dark to light, pink blobs featured as did an eye, pink then white/lilac. Lilac spots on white, black dust? Moving around like TV channels of snow! Saw a sunset sky, clouds and colours. My head did hurt a bit but it was relaxing. I felt myself drifting into a dream at the end, saw an old house with a beekeeper. It feels like stepping inside the consciousness and experiencing it as a flow, a constant changing picture of colour and image felt very relaxed after. The more I concentrated on my breath the more vivid things were, more movement etc. felt happy, calm, at peace. Felt the tangible sense that ‘life’ and conscious life is a journey moving forwards in constant motion, ever changing, but rich and beautiful, if you choose to see it. "
"Very hard to explain specifically what I saw… There were a lot of tunnels weaving into each other, turning into one huge kaleidoscope. Everytime I closed my eyes harder, this again radically changed my visuals. I have left with a feeling of serenity; this was a genuinely beautiful experience. Thank you for giving the opportunity.

Also, Jon Hopkins was the perfect candidate to soundtrack the experience."
"I felt generally really relaxed, figuring out different images. I try to explain them as follows.
I feel like travelling in a tunnel of light, green and red. When the music was melodic the tunnel was really clear, but when the music become as only a loud disturbing sound; all colour mixed up.
When lights go down I saw as a coloured (blue) cloud.
With high intense light I felt uncomfortable (I started moving my fingers and feet) and I see only a white cloud with fast moving black mark.
At ¾ time of experience I started again to travel in a tunnel, this with white and yellow light. As in point 1, it changed with disturbing sounds.
At the end, with extremely relaxing sound I saw a cloud of yellow light.
PS: When I write “travelling in a tunnel” is like we see in futuristic movies.
PPS: In pictures 1 and 2 there is black hole at the centre. 
*bottom cut off from view*"
"I felt I was on a voyage into outer space where I visited lots of different worlds entering through different vortexes. I felt like I was flying forwards and backwards and moving into and out of different realms, darting about inquisitively - a bit like a fly! At moments when I left one world and entered another there were geometric shapes and kaleidoscope patterns signalling a change of universe. At one moment I saw and felt there were humans alongside me walking in front of me - another universe or world perhaps. It was an extremely colourful experience. I felt I saw all manner of colours and shapes and patterns. At first I felt apprehensive and tense but I relaxed into the experience and allowed myself to enter into it rather than resist it which was my default."
"I mostly saw real things. I pictured my family, I saw “winter”, which is a 6-year-old labrador (dog) that I recently met. I saw myself wandering in nature and in the mountains, where I feel myself most happy.
I don’t think I was out of my body. It seemed like when you are between awake and sleep. When you are still connected to outside sounds and colour but your mind wanders through different experiences.
Perhaps there’s some connection between what we experienced in the past and the sounds/colours you ‘......’ see. "
"I felt calm, relaxed and felt the galaxy and space rotating.

I saw definite shapes + beautiful colours come in and out + stars.

It was like a child kaleidoscope or at an old fashioned fun fair going round in little chairs with your feet dangling down. I felt calm + beauty in the world.

I saw space to breathe when it went dark + at the bottom ankles *bottom line cut off*"
"It always started with slowly moving translucent orbs drifting past each other. Later on, I saw more earthy colours, brown, taupe, grey, but early on it was much brighter. I used the mask a few times when the strobes were at their highest intensity, as the physical movement of my eyelids became too much for me. I found it too intense at times, and wanted more time with the slower movement. Much of the time, in the outer corner of each eyes there was a carousel of photos, black and white but mainly sepia. Not of anyone I know but street scenes of the 40’s, 50’s? I’m in my 30’s so not memories of real times but perhaps my brain making sense of the shapes. "
"It is really hard to capture in words. At times it felt meditative and at other parts it felt euphoric. The array of colours and patterns at times were overwhelming. It went from feeling like dawn with a bright orange sun to hurtling through space. Towards the end it felt like we were coming back to earth. I could hear a helicopter and see its lights and the sea with the ripple of the water from its propellers. At the end it felt like we had ended too soon.
At many points it felt like dawn (orange sun) brought you back from your journey and the darkness stilled your mind momentarily. "
"It was mainly a changing landscape of geometric patterns and colours, usually with something standing out in the centre far away. This central image was visually a white figure that looked like a person wearing white and I kept wondering if my eyes were slightly open and what I was seeing was the person across from me I often saw my own hands folded in front of me but did not feel that my eyes were open at all. "
"Initially I just saw darkness but then colours snapped into focus and I could see the universe. I saw black holes forming and collapsing. I saw clouds drifting slowly then fast as if they were fast forwarded. The clouds were light pink, orange, yellows, purple + blue. I saw crashing waves. Also many different colours. At one point I saw very clearly a pink, rose-like flowers. It was so vivid. It snapped into view and then slowly faded away. I whispered “wow” outloud.

Towards the end I saw a horizon in the dark. I could see the lights from houses on the shore. I had a sense of myself standing at a distance, looking out to sea and feeling a sense of warmth + calm looking at those."
"I had little idea of what to expect from Deep listening. I had probably expected to be exposed to random sounds and noises more than a connected and deliberate piece (or pieces) of music.
I am very plugged into work and other activities via my phone at all times so the act of putting that away and sitting for a short while before entering was very pleasant.
The breathing exercises helped me to relax and centre myself. The space was very comfortable and I felt on my own in a good way while also conscious of my partner beside me.
The music was deep and complex with nuanced shifts. I was surprised when it was over - as I had drifted somewhat to a state of relaxation.

Thank you so much for making this possible - a very enjoyable and relaxing experience overall. "
"I felt like I was at a festival or a rave, but instead of watching the back lights/the display. I was in them floating through a kaleidoscope of colours.
The lights and patterns changed colour and shapes. In time with the music. At times the background of the visuals was separate to the forefront - moving at different speeds. It brought thoughts to my mind of heaven, euphoria, but also relaxation - I didn’t want it to end and wished I was experiencing this whilst floating. Some of the intense fast music beats brought with them deeper colours of red which could feel slightly scary but mostly amazing. There were moments where my mouth was open in awe like watching fireworks or stars and my heart pounded but I felt glued in place. The patterns I saw varied in shapes from circles to like *2nd page missing*"
"This was the second time today; it was more intense than the first time, I saw similar colours and patterns turning, pulsing, folding in and out, but I seemed to be more in the middle of it; I could perceive depth, big balls of patterns turning in front of me and then I was right in the centre of it, even so I could feel my body I felt I had left it, floating in space. The first time I perceived the experience to be very short, less than 10 minutes, while the second time it seemed to be much longer, maybe 20 minutes. The colour and patterns often change very suddenly and at some points I wished I could have stayed a bit longer with one to study it and explore what is behind.
The first time the pattern came quite close, I felt I could break through then but did only do that the second time… Also my breathing changed, got ‘......’

*2nd page missing*"
"*1st page missing*

I didn’t choose to lose control. I didn’t feel it being a process yet I entered into an experience my mind subconsciously painted for me.
I stopped asking questions in the moment, trying to note intensely reflective thoughts. My conscience turned off and allowed a different force to control the experience.
Not out of choice, yet not forcibly. I let myself be guided.
A force hold quickly grew and told my doubts and constant questioning to be still, to witness and to view yet not question.

Be still and slow. Submit control."
"Mostly hexagon shapes in various colours. Starting and ending in bright orange, I found after a while I could change the shapes from hexagon to circles to squares with my mind. I could also change the direction of travel from tunnels to sideways travel, to starbursts. I couldn’t change the colours just shapes and directions. I had an astral travel experience via meditation once, it reminded me of that. It’s amazing what your mind can do. (I have a slight headache now though.)
Amazing experience!!!!"
"Loads of blue + orange with star shape at centre. Also near end like a sunflower not sure was I dreaming. Didn’t really think much is as if I was devoid of thought. Can’t remember a lot of it. Very enjoyable.
I felt it was short period of time probably 10 mins. "
"Lots of coloured stars mostly yellow, mint green all on right side and a vivid sky blue top left. A pupil of an eye possibly my pupil. A beautiful shape of purple this filled the whole visual field. All of what I saw was divided into four even parts with mostly stars on the bottom right and hexagons above like beehives I felt very relaxed and quite sleepy when it was over. Felt I was flying through time. "
"It is almost impossible to describe all the visualisations I experienced. They came and went in a flash - at least most of them. Some lingered and then faded away. The drawings are what I “think” I saw or what I remember I think I saw.
Even now the images are all merging together in my brain and I fear in an hour or so, I will only vaguely remember anything. Like a dream fading into the ether. Remembering the memory rather than the actual event.
I feel the images depended on the speed of the light changing, and the frequency of the sound.Each combination containing (producing) a different image…."
"Colours - mainly warm orange.
Some blue, green, grey, black, red.
Multitudes of shapes - honeycomb. Circles, oblongs.
Patterns approaching, receding.
Not discomfort but not peaceful or soothing, was aware of my breathing - did not lose touch with reality.
Thought of flickering lightbulb, poor TV reception.
Is this what disco goers experience?
Found visualisations from sound very strong - did visualisations change what I saw - colours and shapes??"
"Wow - what a beautiful experience! I entered with some anxiety and sweaty palms from the anticipation of the unknown, but once the colours and patterns began their dance I was entranced and able to leave behind my physical body and enter a dream-like state. I allowed the colours to guide my thoughts and felt as if I was being shown other worlds. I could see geometrics, flashing and patterns spinning - colours like light splitting through a prism and then suddenly bright, red and blue, then shapes turning - all geometrical but varied everytime I had tears in my eyes and had to relax and trust that I was safe enough to explore my inner mind's eye. Afterwards I felt calm and connected to others after a collective experience that seemed to profoundly effect each one of us in different ways. Thank you x"
"I loved it. It was very kaleidoscope-like with colours I’ve never seen before. 
I felt like I was free from body and able to look around.
When it all calmed down I felt a sense of calm a sense or message to let go of the loss of my mother at 3 years of age. Be at peace with it. Let it go. 
Very emotional. A good few tears.
My god, if I can take this with me going forward there will be a new chapter in my life. I am 50 now, imagine 47 years of untreated mourning.
This has changed me. I wonder what it would do a second or third time?
To summarise - closure with *heart shape*
Thank you. "
"At the very end it felt like a resolution as if the whole world and myself were one with purpose.
Throughout I saw an amazing array of patterns and colours. The sound was super - both ‘.......’ and relaxing. It changed my visuals as the sounds changed.

The type and variety and position of the flickering lights changed the colours and patterns of my visuals. 
When it was dark it felt heavier. "
"The light changed between feeling both light and uplifting and heavy and compressing.

It felt very intense, as if everything was closing in from around and reaching a boiling point. At these stages I felt very uncomfortable and a little frightened.

I had no sense of how long the experience lasted, but found myself drifting between imagination and visual stimulation, sometimes unsure which was which.

As well as the intense flashes, I was amazed how heavy the darkness felt, and how black it could get. We were gently lifted out of this with the soft glow and peaceful music, but I am unsure how I would feel if this pace were to change rapidly.

The intensity of this project was amazing. "
"The dreamachine, to me felt as though it were pulling at memories without fully revealing them. There was a warmness to this end a familiarity, however I could not put my finger on it nor did I really care, I was comfortable, relaxed and separated from the world for a short time. 
Time too felt manipulated. If the red headed lady had walked in and said it had been three days I would not have been surprised, if she had said it been five minutes the feeling would be the same.
I saw blue skies, different shades of the sun, the experience felt, ultimately, like a worship of sound and light whereby the two were showing off and manipulating time while I marvelled and appreciated. "
"Initially felt tense - deep breathing helped to relax - I was thinking of yoga sessions and tried to relax deeper - soon I felt myself letting go - the music was relaxing - I definitely had lots and lots of dreams - racing - I can’t really say what I dreamt of - I can’t remember but I was in different world/dimensions with different people - maybe celebrities/movie stars - I ain’t can’t really say - I fell asleep a few times I awoke to horrible alarm sounding noises - repetitive noises and harsh lights - I couldn’t get back to sleep I was fully aware of surroundings then - looking around the room - was definitely an immersive experience - would love to do it again, I have no idea how long it lasted, maybe 30-40 mins, overall very therapeutic. The sun came up and alarm sounding I was wide awake, I can’t wait to do the high sensory.  "
"I felt that I was following something
To a new place
I was aware of thing, people around me then they were gone
Thoughts broke into the journey
But then brought me back to journey. Several time bright light bathed us I felt actual joy
Other time I thought I was being left behind I felt sad, even panic.
But then I was back on the journey
I got somewhere, somewhere new
It was a calm place, somewhere I wanted to be.
I could have stayed there.
When it ended, I felt separated a little from my body, my limbs heavy, I have to reconnect

"Initially tense @ strobe lighting but that passed.
Variety of visuals of geometric shapes depending on the intensity + squares of lights
Sharp image suddenly changing to cloud like blurs on sudden change from strobe to constant light. 
Feeling of warmth and tendency to raise face towards the intense solid light - i.e the sun. 
Panning of sound created a feeling that vision was also panning @ the sound.
Thought provoked spinning of shapes (I don’t like spinning so this wasn’t desired but was controllable).
Music intensity was very well arranged. Could be increased further at the crescendo with a stronger beat.
Could potentially be longer 
Double layer of patterns in some cases.
Top level geometric @ strobe 
Bottom level Static - a scene that was there but couldn’t be looked @ directly.

Feeling of flow, with changes in music from moving b/wards to f/wards. "
"I felt very relaxed and aware of changing sense of inner space, particularly, I think, under blue light when I felt on the brink of an outer space on several occasions, including a sense of travelling in space for a few memorable moments.

Occasionally, I felt I was inside or part of a lava lamp but there were also many ‘......’ where I was aware of little additionality apart from the light and sounds. I meditate a lot (™) and wondered whether any habit on focusing on a inner light prevented greater stimuli from occurring."
"Nothing profound, but enjoyed the tie-dye patterns. Tie-dye with lots of maltese crosses on the fabric. Primarily reds + pinks, no yellows, blues or greens.

I think my audio alone might have had a deeper impact. My mind was busy trying to decipher light patterns and I was distracted by that a bit.

I felt a sense of wellbeing and increased generosity of spirit for everyone in the room.
It occurred to me that this would be good to do post-crisis- to give you some moments of detachment and sinking into nothingness. "
"Letters, checkerboards at the beginning felt like rollercoasters, spinning wheels, sticky wall rides in the middle, towards the end grass, flowers 
Colours of purple and teal like I hadn’t seen before. Felt very fast.
Also - felt physical sensations for sure. - back of neck, facial, tingly. 
Loved it!

Letters at the start felt like a typewriter coming apart and spinning

Also felt very short! Felt like 10 mins. "
"Haunting - at times I felt as if I was seeing supernatural beings.
Fear - could feel myself feeling as if I was falling into an abyss and nothing to hold onto
I felt as if I should be grabbing out for something to save me.
Calmness - at times I felt calm with the soft noise. And soft more static shapes which I felt would be how it feels when you die and your soul leaves the body.
I really enjoyed the experience and couldn’t believe the amount of light and colours visible to me.
Thank you. "
"Weightless - like I was separate from my body.
Tired and full of sleep - like coming round from an anaesthetic
The experience seemed to last forever yet simultaneously very short.
I saw shapes and patterns - then nothing at all; like my mind was sleeping even when I was conscious.
The music would reignite the creation of pattern in my mind's eyes but the music and lights never seemed connected, always separate from one another. It was very peaceful; if death was this ethereal no one would fear it. "
"Kaleidoscope patterns         Endless ripples in every direction
Techno fidget spinners         Elation and joy
Alien spaceship landing       Spinning
Tyre tracks                           Like being in an
Whipped cream                   intergalactic spaceship.
Red, blue and yellow and colours   I’d never seen - bright, vivid
indigo                                               like experiencing the big bang
An eye in the centre            Atomic structure
Fine lines and blobs in fractals"
"Mixture of scenes: orange sunrises and then dark scenes with klein-blue webs. Those were the monochrome bits.
The best bits implied fractal cubes - often either arranged in grids or spirals. Primarily blue + yellow.
There were also forests, astronaut figures etc.
At various places there was a sense of movement - often falling up, which is pretty cool. "
"I feel more emotional than I expected to feel, during and afterwards. I also drifted in and out of remembering I was in a room with other people, which had an impact on how I felt at the time.
I wanted to open my eyes at various points but resisted as I thought it might ‘break the spell’ of this pretty awesome journey.
I saw lots of colours and geometric shapes, different layers of shapes that had their own speed and motion, and distance, there was real depth.
When the music started to broaden so much that it created gaps, I felt like I wanted to laugh, a lot (I stopped short when I remembered where I was!)

Quite amazing, will likely be processing this for a long time. "
"Soothed, really relaxed. I felt a real sense of euphoria and had tears. These were from a sense of joy. The colours I saw were really rich and softly flowing. I don’t see any recognisable forms, just abstract patterns, always moving, mostly symmetrical but sometimes moving side to side. I loved the sensation and didn’t want it to stop. 
I was really aware all the way through.
I couldn’t really draw what I saw, just what I felt. "
"Elephants, birds, dogs, and white, stylistic
Expanding forever
Red, blue, green
Sort of like playing card patterns
Moving into moving tube (beige)
Music disturbed and the shapes became disrupted and then the tube came.
Red and black
Red and white"
"Dreamachine experience
I felt happy and warm in the glow of a specific yellow light. It reminded me of a hot summers afternoon in SA. the intense flashes was overwhelming for my brain, it tried to make sense of it, but it was information overload. Funny because there is no information, just light! Is all information really just light?
The dark colours was pleasant, even though they didn’t evoke an emotion. I liked the dark blue. The bright patterns that flashed made me feel uneasy. I could smell things. All senses.
Music was very powerful, changing the shapes and intensity.
Great experience!"
"I found it hard to switch off my mind was thinking over things I need to do for work and also back on recent activities. Maybe as I was part of a group it was harder to focus on me as I was very aware of them and hoping they were ok

When the lights became brighter I began to feel warmth like facing the sun. I began to then feel like I was sitting on a beach listening to water, watching clouds.

However when the noise of what I felt was like a helicopter became slightly triggering it took my attention away from beach, made me feel something was wrong as associated helicopter which flying over city when trouble is happening. Also created a feeling of that I was ready to come out. "
"Dark space with patterns a bit like mist moving /clouds. No real colours but some dark blue shapes. At one point felt brightness + warmth a bit like a sunrise. Relaxing but hard at times to push out intrusive thoughts re “to do list”. At the end I felt very relaxed and reluctant to leave the space and experience.
Felt a sense of a heart beating through the sound. At one point also felt the sensation of a helicopter fly past. A positive relaxing experience. "
"It was really nice, it keeps me to remember all staffs which I had planned to do/complete, but I forget to do, and things which I am still planning to do in next times as a big life plans.

I saw different light colours and the aeroplane sound took my attention unless before that my brain was just analysing different tasks to submit CV, personal statement…
Remembering family members, especially my last born sister and my dad. I saw my self being a well dressed nurse which is my life dream to be. I feel I put myself somewhere alone and getting sleep into."
"It takes time to switch off. To get ‘there’. And when you get ‘there’, its hard not to wonder if you’ve arrived… or if there’s further to go. Which I guess there always is. The best moments that seem to come from nowhere. Your world (eyes open or closed) can be filled with light; from the side, from below, from somewhere else. But it’s more than just light. It’s presence. I found myself sinking a couple of times. Not in a distressing or uncomfortable way - more like a realisation I was in the wrong place and was settling into a new one. The sonic experience: I enjoyed the sound (level/quality) - but will admit to being frustrated by the music. (I am a musician and composer). There’s so much potential to connect with the conscious + subconscious mind, and I get distracted by the generic, mono-harmonic, synthesised cliche of “meditation music”. But I get that it works for most. All in all, a beautiful hour. Thank you!"
"Underwater - the sea - but tranquil, floating, dappled sunlight, at peace, not drowning but extremely calm.
Like on a journey and then the music changed and sounded like something had broken down - clear image of cell-like structures in a spiral pulsating getting tighter in the middle. Red in the background.
The music became more light + felt like new day, in a meadow with flowers over me, couldn’t see the sun but could feel the warmth, the light. "
"I saw crosses coming out from the centres in all directions and the side of the frame would move and it would feel as though I was spinning.
I often saw the faces of people I know folding inwards towards me as if they were ‘.......’
At a point when the universe changed, I saw that I was climbing a long tunnel. When I reached the top there was a large gate/door made of wood that was open to an enormous castle in sandy coloured stone. I could just see inside and saw that it kept going and there were people there. "
"I felt that I was in a moving towards a point, it was very colourful but filled with bubbles of all different colours but only two colours at a time.
Eventually I don't remember, but the sound resonating through my body made me feel very relaxed. Tried to continue with the breathing which then re-ignited the visual experience. But very relaxing and elating. "
"My second visit - very different. The first time was almost visually overwhelming, music and colours synchronising in the form of geometric shapes with hard edges. This time was more spherical, orb-like shapes, less intense, only occasionally breaking into high-constant geometric shapes.
The sense of constant movement - churning, convoluted -
Sometimes like vast spaceships reconfiguring their shapes.
The same sense of having a panoramic screen in a new-space, just beyond reach. I used to feel this way, of the space as a screen when eyes closed much more as a child.
I want to keep coming back to this - like being a psychonaut, a traveller in inner space (cheesy-sounding, I know!)"
"I saw white and red sequences making a path that would go back, uplit or ‘......’ red. Then the squares became more visible, they had like wrinkles in them.

After I just saw the desert, all sand-colour. I felt like a dead Egyptian. It was flowing somewhere. Then I fell asleep. "
"An extraordinarily vivid, swirling geometry of colour - like an amazingly immersive explosion of patterns fading in and out, with intermittent coloured and patterns separating them. At times, like watching a black hole swallow kaleidoscopic galaxies - with a rolling inevitably. At times, swarms of hexagonal snow. Like an incredibly detailed CGI. Like a visualisation of music from an old PC monitor. A startling firework display of rotational symmetry. But everywhere you can see - across your whole range of vision. And with a detail that was staggering - a fractal-like infinity. "
"A central revolving spiral composed of leaf-like scales shimmering in radiant colours of the rainbow. In every single scale the rainbow colours were breaking just like in clouds in the sky. Moving and changing in speed and size with the music playing, breathing, pulling me closer in and pushing me further out. Intensity with increasing relaxation. Flying. At this point I lost any sense of my body. I’m flying through a wormhole of in themselves revolving spirals, faster and faster, feeling lighter and every second."
"there’s someone hiding behind the colours
i see the birth of the universe twice
then think of my egg and bacon bun 
and how it’s sitting in my tummy
i see the unseen and the whole world calmly collides 
and then I worry that my crush hasn’t answered my text
i feel peace and fear in the same breath
did I turn off the light when I left home?
does god exist, is it him behind the colours?
What will I have for lunch?
Should I have trained as an astronaut?
how small, how big the world is
my feet as cold, my heart is open, I flew through
space twice, for lunch I think I want rice. "
"Shifting multicoloured shapes. Very geometric often. Some thin shapes (like needles), some blockier (like hexagons). Colours ranged from white, to icy blue, greens, oranges, violets, dark purples, to black. A very pleasant and restful experience I think, though, I was expecting a more profound experience. Thoroughly enjoyable overall. "
"Feeling of calm but also anticipation
Mostly geometric shapes but also a lighthouse, humanoid forms, including a representation of the Egyptian god Talmud, sperm, ova, babies (not in detail, more as a silhouette), sunrise, sunset, germs, bacteria, atoms, cells… kind of went from a micro-perspective to a macro one. 
A couple of times it got so bright it was almost alarming.
Struggled to stay present a few times, my mind started to wonder towards things that I have to do, or are stressing me out (work, money etc)
Lots of planets, stars/suns. Seeing the earth from space.
Everytime the lights went down (black) then I saw thin green lines in a kind of matrix."
"First I felt there was sunshine on my eyelids - warm + bright + lovely
Then I saw lots of different patterns geometrical dots, lines, hexagons all flashing in time to the rhythm of the music.
At one point the beat of the music was loud and insistent and I felt mildly that I didn’t like it - the patterns were a little - “aggressive” seems a strong word, but the closest."
"I saw like a kaleidoscope of geometric shapes that periodically disappeared off screen almost changing colour + direction slightly but as if they built up into a concentration and then almost a climax before bringing in a new wave of colour pattern or direction.

I saw black + white patterns
Green + blue patterns
and almost white/orange haze that built in intensity.
I felt disconnected from my body at times like I had left it and my body because weightless like as if in space. "
"Beautiful journey. I couldn’t stop falling asleep. I saw lots of kaleidoscopes of colour, mostly with a centre in the middle, radiating outwards. Sometimes there were lines - horizontal, which moved in waves to the music.
I felt pressure on my elbow, slightly central and to my right. I felt something in my chest and then a distinctive ‘jump’ at the front of my body in my sex organs.
I saw a young man sitting sideways but looking at me directly. He was dark haired and eyed and he acknowledged me with a facial expression.
I may have now been dreaming.
The colours were varied - red a lot, purple, pink etc."
"Feel relaxed after
Sometimes I felt
It feels like sometimes you're gonna feel out of breath. But then you realise this is something you have imaginated.
Lots of shapes, I seen a man standing to my right. Lots of intense patterns, guide paced. Throbbing kinda.
For me I felt like I kept falling asleep and walking up to this as a dream.
Cool AF experience.
I also think if there was an option to meditate beforehand you would have an even more intense trip. "
"I saw patterns, moving patterns. I felt anxious at first and then relaxed. Overwhelmed, then calm: I thought the experience was very interesting, I tried to let the patterns and figures unfold without thinking too much.
I saw moving patterns, colours of red, amber, pink, then greys and whites, flower shapes, splats, shells, catherine wheels, trees. Forest scenes, beach scenes, winter snow scenes. "

Green flowers waving in the darkness of the forest floor
Called back to reality by the siren outside

"I felt like I was back to a primordial human existence - high up in a brightly green leafy tree, high up above the canopy of a thick tropical forest. It was a sunny morning, and the tree and air was damp from morning dew. I was at peace and relaxed.
The images I saw were mostly geometric patterns, repeating symmetrically. I did not see anything I could relate to the physical world - it was abstract shifting patterns. "
"I saw oranges and yellows within was calming and gentle, as the lights intensity increase and ‘......’ I saw shapes mostly coming from a central space and I saw colours ranging from yellows to reds but hexagons letters and numbers. As the intensity  increased I felt uncomfortable + would of preferred an experience which was a series of ‘......’ changing light much like the start the visuals + light became quite jarring for me and I left the room. I feel spaced out + experienced some fear in the Dreamachine. I enjoyed the gentle music + the centre start."
"At first, a series of kaleidoscope patterns, with brief intermediate trips catapulting through space and deep under the ocean. 
A fear pauses in the middle to breathe where it all ‘clicked’ 
The end where I was under a landing helicopter.
And a few moments where it was all too much and I chose to sink back to darkness, away from the adventure. "
"I felt safe, happy, content. My mind settled and let the experience happen. I imagine it lasted for a while but it felt like 5 mins only. I felt I could have stayed there for hours and hours.
I would love it to become permanent fixture in Belfast. It brings peace and relaxation and can only imagine benefits for mental health. This was my 3rd time in high sensory and each was different and similar in some ways. Today was most peaceful I ever felt. I just hope I will be able to experience this again as this is the only few times in my life when my brain quiets down, slows down, I’m finally at peace, not thinking (overthinking) happy, safe and relaxed. 
Thank you for bringing it to Belfast. "
I saw a red rose like flowers opening and then a jellyfish-like red object morning like the capabilities of my eyes. I also saw a laughing Buddha's outline expanding and chequered battle and flowers like that on a wallpaper. It was a very happy experience to see the inside of a womb like how I must have seen when in my mother’s womb. I also saw the sunlight like it was a bright day but without the heat. Towards the end a brain scan image popped up in my head. I felt peaceful and wanted to continue the experience. Overall recurring theme was flower petals opening and colour exploding like it does when mixed in water.
"Incredible combinations of ‘......’, colours, shapes, sensorial feeling driven by the musical beats. The sleep of conscience is conducted by ‘..........’ in a colourful ‘......’ experience. Fractals, vividly ‘.....’ dancing ‘.....’ colours. "
"As if every cell in my body was being balanced and energised. Feelings of intense happiness and joy. Throat Chakra clearing. Intense weight on my chest. Visions of marching through a desert with a whole line of people. Then sailing away with them in a huge sailing ship. 

The feelings of exhilaration was intense as the music intensified. And then the sweet calmness as it settled and gentle piano."
"I’m a visual person, so a lot of it came in images. My first feeling was of floating in a deep ocean, letting the light of the changing day and night pass over me. Next I settled into a meditative state, a blank white world where I sat in the nothingness, the surface I was sitting on - a reflective sheet of water. Music erupted from my palms. Sitting still wasn’t enough, and in the next sequence I was dancing decorating the blank world with ribbons of ink from movement. I looked into the reflective pod at me feet. My head crashed through the surface and entered a black world, where I painted ribbons of white. When the sounds of cluttering started, I saw a giant worm circling me, getting closer and closer. Eventually I was engulfed, crouched in the foetal position, floating in the new nothing of the giant worm."
"Right now I feel nervous inside 
Right in the centre of my chest.
I think what just happened was that the music represented + the night life
Being born - beautiful music + happy light followed. I take it that was childhood and then we jog on - but oh then came this abrupt red noisy light + noisy music - I guess in life we have kids/trauma and so the trauma was there and then we pass that - but that noisy red music was still there - I could hear it. It was in the background - even when the music began happier - it never went back to childhood/the beautiful music at the start - that noisy red music was always

"My experience began with lines darting past each other, zig zagging over a dark blue background, I got a lot of spiralling beads of white with a powerful focal point in the centre building up if I fixed my gaze for a while. 
As I darted my eyes the around and into corners the patterns world disperse instantly creating whole new patterns. 
I also at times had what looked like a wintery frosty landscape that had a very 3 dimensional feel to it, like I was peering into a strange writing scene as white likes flashed around. "
"A light that filled me new the beginning or the end the noise of time trying to see all of time all at once trying to hold all that time all at once. Let go let go let go stop looking and holding so hard let go look around how fast time moves through you or are you moving moving through space so fast and light and unafraid now calm, past distant suns that come closer and fill you, disappear and in the dark in the dark in the ‘.....’ dark the delicious glowing blue have of my soul like a kaleidoscope of delicious vibrant feeling without words multiple, multiplying without a sound or question."
"Warm glowing sunshine, stretching far + wide, taking up all the space surrounding me. 
Then I was seeing flashes of light through big trees. Almost like riding a bike and moving fast and the sunlight cascaded down on my face and body.
Then it was like floating in water with the sun glistening down below the surface. Reflecting off the bottom of a pool or the sea bed.
Then I felt a sense of being plucked upward into the sky so softly.
Then dropping downward towards the ground but from a great height, almost like sky-diving (I’ve never sky-dived, but what I would imagine to feel like)
Starry galaxy, in the solar system
Calmness throughout. "
"Beautiful blue and orange patterns, ‘......’ back in space as red squares came towards me. Fell in and out of attention at points thoughts came in but then they went again back to the visuals, felt happy, excited, slightly anxious at the falling back bits with red wanted it to carry on for longer. Also dark purple with queen diamonds. Thought probably what an acid trip was like, felt much shorter, like 5-10 mins but apparently was 25 mins so definitely lost track of time. Could have carried on for longer. Made me aware of how much chatter I have in my head most of the time! "
"The beginning reminded me of my first experience of being in a chaotic nightclub environment, which I love. It also reminded of hours of staring at the computer log in background from the 90’s.
As the experience continued I felt like I was in the tunnel at the beginning of doctor who. (but with better audio)
I really enjoyed the shitting patterns after a while. 

The experience was in 2 parts - fun - bright - chaos.
Then immersive in a calming almost spiritual experience.
Like enlightening  - I felt the presence of my brother and it was really beautiful.   "
"Reminded me when I was doing the practice of phosphenism. When I was 18 (now 32) I started practising phosphenism. It helped me to become the best student in my uni and to be able to learn 50-70 pages by heart everyday. Phosphenism consisted in fixing a light (no more than 100W, no LED on energy saving) for 30 secs and then turn off the light and watch the phosphenism (the “echo” of the light) - this leads to developing memory intelligence, activity and more mental faculty. I have stopped the practise but going through this took me to the next step and brought me back here. 
I also read how ‘......’ can be ‘......’ in light etc…etc…"
"A thick texture dotted by the circle sounds of the gongs + the bells.
A forest.
Wading through the sea at Murtaugh beach - the spray around my legs and ankles like jewels. 
I am huge, like a goddess of the sea + I can wade through the sea to the isle of man + with a sweep of my arm draw an enormous arc in the sky.
Swimming + strong. Level + still.

But also swaying, slow dancing on the land with bare feet. "
"Started off quite difficult to get my mind to relax and lost sense of time, time felt like breaths rather than minutes, seen a lot of different colours at the start and then became people, spotted one of my grandad’s who is dead and has been for years which was odd because hadn’t seen his face face that clearly even in my own memory in years. Experienced a lot of jungle like scenes with lions or what I thought were lions."
"Great relaxation
Initially in the ‘taster’ sessions, I felt like I was moving into another parts of the universe, but my mind made me pull back + refocus as it felt too dangerous.
Lots of colours - all different kinds. 
Often complementary colours that I didn’t know I knew. Couldn’t have told you before I went in. (maybe they’re not even complimentary but just thought they looked great together - like pale pink + yellow - gold. 
Lots of the nature-shapes started with colour in the centre + then speed out.
Sometimes regular shapes (mostly) but

*2nd page missing* "
"The time went very quickly. 
Surprising because it felt very “normal”, I felt normal, ordinary but I liked that I kind of knew it was subliminally not normal. I enjoyed being with myself in my own mind, not just completely relaxed thoughts. Some things that were bothering me but in a way it was nice to be able to reflect on those troubling thoughts. (I have to fill in an application form. I don’t like them)"
"Firstly experiencing a very vibrant orange, when flashing it was just morphing from one. Style of pattern to the other. Often creating crosses in the centre and had the centre as a fixed point that everything else was falling in around. Colours I was experiencing, oranges, while, turquoise, light blue; greens, pinks.. Shapes that I was seeing focused on the centre. Spider web as in drawing, circles, straight lines going vertical and horizontal. Then almost like 2 circles joined together but flashing in the colours. Box shape patterns that looked like the optical eye illusion. A constant vibration and back of everything, vibration of all that pulses and slowly expands and contracts.  FUCKING COOLS."
"A lot of moving shapes and colours but there were also some scenes that I have tried to draw as a storyboard. The first was a dark long-filled planet with a cliff in the foreground and a volcano type thing in the background. The second was like the controls and shadow of a spaceship - luminous green bars and angular and a shadow/figure but I’m not sure.
Third was like a fire/black hole angry eye, maybe like the sun but it was looking down and consuming the space or sucking it towards it. This sounds dark but it wasn’t scary, the last was the helmets and face of a man, spaceman type figure. But he was lying on his back and then was buried by all of the colours like sand. "
"2nd visit (1st was last week)
(I experience quite deep relaxation. When the lights go off the background becomes black and I can often see bright yellow grids)
(I don’t find it stressful. When it is dark at the end of the experience I get more blue colours like water or air bubbles in water.)
(I recommend it to others. When it flashes most and is brightest I see the most geometric and bright morning patterns.)
(The music is pleasant and not too loud. In the less intense periods I see bright or bold colours like dark yellow or brown with purple.)
*The brightest flashing times are most interesting. "
"Right at the end before the lights came up it was black and all I could see were these slinky purple lines dancing back and forwards, like snakes.

Sometimes it was so bright I felt like I was looking at the sun and I’d want to turn my face away and other times it would feel warm-right to the corners of my eyes and body

Sometimes I found myself smiling involuntarily.

It was like planets collapsing-what I imagined space would look like when I was little

Sometimes it was like I was a light shining in a projection and film was passing in front and creating a movie I couldn’t see properly."
"After spending some time contemplating the practicalities of the dreamachine the fact that from any seated angle the central light looks lenticular like and eye, pondering why the speeches weren’t set up to play more with binaural effects - I managed to ‘turn off’ enough to slip into the intense hypnagogia that I experience any time I close my eyes for a few moments. As such, while the experience *was* relaxing, it wasn’t any more trippy or transformative than getting settled into a long train journey.

I was also disappointed it didn’t last longer was hoping I’d have time for my socks to dry after cycling here in the rain!
I may come back for the more intense version if I have the opportunity. "
"I saw the deepest hue of blue I’d ever seen. I saw shades of colours that I had never seen before - a lot of purples, blues and reddish tones.

I saw a lot of fractals and patterns that kind of exploded like fireworks.

I went extremely deep into my psyche - I’m used to this because I meditate but this time I had a profound loss of my physical presence in the space. Almost like an ego death. Complete weightlessness. "
"Weirdly enough, I felt calm but overwhelmed with thoughts at the same time. My mind seemed to race through everything that I’ve been thinking about the past few days but in a flowing, disconnected way as if it was filing through. Bizarrely, on the other side of the experience I can’t recall the specifics of these thoughts. I definitely had a sense of transportation and hallucination. Really fascinating stuff - keen to ‘......’ for high sensory.

Also: Very warped perception of time in there."
"I saw life, death and rebirth. It started with being on a moving train at sunset. The train kept on going faster and faster. Life just got so fast I couldn’t keep up. It was so fast my soul disconnected from my body as it couldn’t keep up with the pace. I felt scared, scared of not being able to keep up with life. Then, by some miracle, life wasn’t so fast anymore. Everything slowed down. Life was peaceful. I was getting better at keeping up. Then, death happened but it wasn’t scary. It felt natural like going to sleep. I even enjoyed it even though it’s unusually something that scares me. Then, it was the rebirth. I found myself in a very bright place surrounded by kind people. Everything felt pure. These kind people were trying to heal me by englobing me with white warm lights, like a hug for my soul, preparing me to be reborn again into the world.  "
"Villeneuve “Tree of life” musical trip. Lisergic. Sound experience.

I saw my life passing by at the side of my partner. Little moments that confirm a human experience. The soundtrack of our lives. Beautiful and deep.

P.S: I missed a little sound intensity. I would like it was a little higher. 

I will ask him to come experience Dreamachine with me. 
Thank you. This is what I needed today.
Forever grateful."
"For me any kind of meditation needs the ‘......’ to be straight. I found the position I was lying in very uncomfortable. I found the music heavy, soulless, and aggressive. My only thought was shall I stay to the end or shall I leave? A few moments longer I would have left. It made me feel intolerant, prickly, and aggressive. "
"I came out of the machine with a deep sense of unease that spiralled into a deeper feeling of mistrust towards everyone and everything. The offers of support from staff only served to further my own sense of alienation. I am someone with a great deal of trauma in my background; finding ‘help’ for my mental health has been loaded with examples of failures from a healthcare system that only knows how to pathologize and medicalise people enough so they can exist and function within the systemic violence we all live in. I wasn’t ready to feel as unsafe as I do - I don’t apportion blame for this. The experience is clearly an amazing project. But perhaps the machine should come with a warning that goes beyond ‘flashing lights’ or ‘loud noises’. For anyone with a long and complicated history of trauma and mental health, as I do, it may be worth saying that feelings of distress and unease might be triggered. It might be worth having a disclaimer on the website - because by the time anyone arrives they are already invested in going ahead with the experience, especially if they come with a friend.

I have been exploring the possibilities of EMDR - Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprogramming - as an evidence based trauma processing therapy, and am on the way to beginning a course of treatment. I’m fairly sure that some of what this Dreamachine does is stimulate some of the same, or similar, functions as EDMR. It might be worth the creators/organisers of this project looking into this - I had the suspicion that the Dreamachine brought some of my traumatic responses to the surface, but without any professional assistance to help me cope/transform it. 

I’m glad it exists, it's powerful and clearly makes an impact on people.

"I started travelling within a fluid, liquid sensation through the flow of blood cells within a capillary of my body. Bubbles flowing, swimming through an expansive ocean deep in the depths of the ocean along the ocean floor. Then a kaleidoscope with many colourful geometrics moving onwards and outwards changing colour constantly. Some geometrics displaying small numbers forming a kind of cosmic map. I felt like I was entering an alternative dimension like dying and transitioning to an outer realm. I found it very relaxing and peaceful despite the intensity of the lights and sound. The music made me feel like I could trust the journey. "

"I had to leave after the trial period. Although the colours from behind the eyes were like a kaleidoscope of colour and geometric shapes, changing, forming many patterns. The light felt too bright and I found it overwhelming. I became anxious rather at peace, but wished my body had reacted differently and relaxed into it to continue the colours.I’ll try the other one. Amazing experience, unlike any other. Will try again…"
"To start with I was focused on colours and patterns mostly-seeing both patches of a single colour-orange, purple and when the light flashes, patterns like a kaleidoscope, symmetrical. Then at one point when I was seeing red and bright white patterns, bursting outwards.
I started telling myself stories about the apocalypse, associating it with fire-explosions-not surprising, considering the current news about war and climate emergency. 
The music didn’t really seem to make much of a difference - I am a lover of music and the background type as here doesn’t really mean much to me."
"Lots of bright flashing colours and shapes turning from one design to another very fast. Sometimes it felt like I was inside it and it covered my whole self. The Thoughts would come back as I wanted to let myself go more. I saw some fleeting objects. One moment I saw a skeleton in a room of gold coins. I felt calm but still aware. Ath the end I saw bright orange and I felt I was traveling backwards inside a layer of earth's crust, really cool !"
"I felt very very relaxed about half way through - I felt a fairly sudden and big release of tension in my neck and shoulders. The relaxation lingered afterwards. For the most part, I didn’t think about anything - although oddly for a few minutes I blacked out, stopped noticing the visuals and started thinking about eating chicken and fish.
I am a vegetarian but have worried lately about energy levels and protein level etc. I thought about this and a wave of guiltlessness about eating meat, but had this experience of animals and us being all equal and unaccountable for need and home should feel guilt. If a vulture eats another animal's kill, why should I feel guilty about eating meat in the supermarket if I didn’t hunt for it. 
I am no better than the vulture and it is "
"Nervous, like I might hold back from seeing something.
Lots of colours and some shapes. I saw an eye, a brain, bricks from a wall being built + some traffic from a birds eye view. 
Left feeling very dazed afterwards - not sure of my thoughts, like I need time to process.
Vivid and intense, sometimes like falling through time and space, everytime I moved my eyes, everything followed me. Saw a tree with lots of branches - no leaves. "
"Took me to dream like scenes reflecting beautiful moments from my childhood but linked to something very current in my life.
Also some more disturbing upsetting fears came to the front around my partner’s health right now but still a moving experience that reminded me of the beautiful things and people I have in my life right now and the news to be present and enjoy what I have. 
Thank you
So powerful and moving
"
"Lots of different colours
Lots of different shapes which while I didn’t recognise then they were familiar
Went from a freeling  of being quite relaxed to slightly apprehensive.
Unique experience it is only “white” light
The music seemed to interfere with the colours and the shapes.
Most shapes were “square” in shape reacting out from the centre"
"It was totally mesmerizing - I saw a lot of coloured lines (mostly red and blue) which moved to cross over each other into a sort of grid that glowed green from behind. It changed at times to glowing golds with large black pillars growing from nothingness and disappearing.
My thoughts mostly disappeared and then came back and intensely focussed on one of two every now and again
It was an intense but strangely relaxing experience"
"I initially felt nervous but once we had done the “taster” session I was fine. 
I saw warm light, followed by numerous different zooming and many sequences of colours. Zooming in and out towards a centre spot. I saw red, oranges, purples, blues and whites. At times I saw tiny stars in the darkness. It is amazing what the mind can interpret from white flashing lights. Thank you, Loved it X"
"My experience was primarily one of being in a 3 dimensional fractal tunnel or tank. Shapes and fractal patterns in various colors criss-crossed my vision or created the feeling of traveling towards or backwards. At some stages I saw images of being in a realistic staircase, of people and words in structured prose, of metal pipes. I heard people talking. I’ve no idea how long the experience lasted or if I was awake or sleeping for some of it. It was enjoyable in its entirety, nothing about it was unpleasant or uncomfortable. At times I thought I was holding something in my hands."
"I saw a lot of pure moving light which felt like being bathed in warm sunshine. This was interspersed with flashing images almost like a flower head in the middle.
I did not find it easy to let myself go in the experience - might be easier next time around. 
Heard helicopter sound towards the end before all went calm"
"I could see what looked like pink light all around, then it was green.
Towards the end I felt as though I was moving backwards although I didn’t feel any motion it just looked as though I was moving away from what was in front of me, which just looked like a dark tunnel. Then it felt like I started to move forwards and didn’t feel like I was walking.running or using my arms or legs at all to move in either direction. It felt as though I was only experiencing the motion in my mind, a bit like a dream!
Thank you Dream Machine!"
"Feeling of nervousness disappears as you emerge into the sounds and light appearing before your eyes.
drifting in and out of the space
Very therapeutic and calming though sometimes intense music brought more alarm 
Now I feel very euphoric as I write this!
Thank you!"
"Very meditative but stimulating. After speaking with the guide and being informed of the experience in advance was nice and also being aware of the other shows/experiences on offer.
I am glad I did this particular one.
I was very inspired. Relaxing. The colours, set up with the tent, surrounding environments, the furniture etc, all very interesting and comfortable. Surprisingly comfortable.
No complaints whatsoever. However, having a pre-existing back complaint. I personally would have liked to lay flat on the floor (yoga style) but this is just personal to me."
"Felt like I was on a journey through the universe. There were waterfalls made of golden stars. I fell down the waterfall and came into a tunnel of brilliant, brilliant blue light.
Traveled past different planets - some gentle and welcoming, some not so much. At the same time, I was traveling further back into my childhood. Finally I was in my mother’s womb. I could feel her heart beating and her swallowing and moving. I was suspended, my arms, floating in front of me like 2 stumps. I saw myself as a vulnerable soul, with so much to go through. I felt compassion and love for myself. 
Crid a bit. I wish it could have lasted longer. It was a great experience
Thank you! xxx"
"Even though I didn't close my eyes, I envisioned (felt?) a fire burning a communal bonfire outside at night with people dancing joyously around it with abandon. Then they were in the ocean, naked, swimming, cleansing, cooling, I felt refreshed and anew. Then it felt like sunbathing, warming- the sun.
The remainder of the time, I felt like I was rising, rising up, with other beings around me rising too. "
"I found some of the light overwhelming, alternating red and green, red and blue patterns coming towards me were making me a little anxious. I stayed with myself. There were solid fields of purple and green which made me feel very peaceful. I felt my mind “go away” - I was drifting. I was not aware of my body.I could feel at times great peace. I could feel the divine-like god. There was a feeling of utter peace. I was present but away. Now I am feeling very “full”. I feel kind of sad. I had a few tears. But it’s a peaceful sadness. I really feel like I had an experience. I feel very quiet about myself. Sometimes it has been stirred and it needs to settle."
"Fucking Crazy. Scary. Blissful.
Kundalini activation.
Meditative energy flow in my body and head and soul
Reminded me of a really intense LSD trip.
Laughter - just the amazement of life and my inner creation.
Worried that my energy flow would be seen as epilepsy as I often shake and move spontaneously. Wanted to let this happen but afraid the guides would interrupt.
Wanted to let my arms move and to dance.
Got more and more peaceful and wanted more and more."
"The bright white steady light + mmm :) like sun in a field, like King’s Cross Station with Harry and Dumbledore, Like peace. like rest, like everything just right-ness
The flashing lights and currents how can things move like that? layes, movement in different directions, swirling. Very often a pink and green flashing square/diamonds, always wherever my focus was intensifying when I focused on it. Lattice squares, interlocking.
Yellow and black swirls like a lava lamp (i helped someone else who’s been here describe it like this) Swirling 
How long did it last? at some point I stopped looking, still could see but I was less focused on what was in front of my eyes, felt so relaxed, didn’t want it to end, though I saw a person’s face, aware of a part of me searching for meaning wanting more, wanting to see a scene with people, like a cartoon or a movie playing in my mind, wanting to relax, to let go, not push, res, res, tes,tes, REST. 
I need rest"
"I felt the hot sun on my face and my feet in the water.
There were often reflections of people and deeply personal experiences, not visions, no clarity. Just nods to feelings and events that are hiding in the corners of my mind. I wonder how colours can connect so closely with what is dormant in my consciousness without really referencing anything specific.
Red and oranges dorman, followed by deep midnight colors"
"I felt very relaxed when the music started and began to see an array of patterns and shapes in a series of bright colours as the experience went on. I saw a tree line shapes and blue (like a sky) and also highlights of people playing football
I thought the whole experience was very immersive and thoughtful and like a hallucinogenic experience to be honest "
It was like a kaleidoscope (unsure how to spell) with lots of colours and shapes rushing by at the edges whilst something exploded or collapsed into the centre. At certain points. I had the impression of seeing the night sky from space. Others felt the pixels on an old Windows XP computer rushing by (or possibly something like chains on a blue- pink and orange were the colours I saw most often. The orange reminded me of closing my eyes from the sin. The pink felt like scenes on the inside of my eyelids with little veins - a bit like the flashback when getting a photo of the back of your eye at the optician.
"Kaleidoscope of geometric patterns.
I mostly saw the colour red. Sometimes with an intense pulsing of light, it hurt my eyes. Sometimes I felt like an intense pattern was only starting and it would go black again. 
Feeling of movement, like traveling through the wormhole.
Sometimes a burst of little white lights."
"It wasn’t a pleasant experience for me. I felt uneasy. The visuals were intense, shifting shapes, many very fast - quicker than I could keep up with. It reminded me of night’s I’ve had insomnia and my mind felt out of control and wouldn’t stop - like flashing images.
I wanted it to be pleasant and spiritual but it wasn't for me, which was disappointing. I could see flashes of things now and then that were something please - like an atom or the universe but mostly it was angry, red flashing, like arrows traveling towards me very fast.
I think it was maybe a bit much for me, a bit too intense. I think I found it an unnerving experience."
"Patterns of blue and red. Sometimes like I was passing through a tunnel at speed. When the lights changed I’d see green and blues in a vision-like pattern -very calm. I drifted off for a while. I didn’t if I was asleep or in a deep state but I was less aware of the lights and sounds. I thought of some people, like my parents, but nothing in particular. I came back to the room (still eyes shut) when there were some loud noises and lights - it felt aggressive and sounded like a war zone with helicopters flying around. It was black and purple and was like I could see the strobe of the helicopter blades. I’d hoped it wasn’t the end as I’d missed a lot of it I think. The last bit was quite relaxing though, but I felt deeply relaxed."
"Very different to the last time I took part in Dream Machine. 
First time there were lots of bright shapes and only two colours. On this occasion I was interested in much more significant bursts of colours and shapes.

I found it difficult to keep up with the visualization that was going on. It was constantly changing and flickering from one thing to the next. Very much like a kaleidoscope.
So strange to experience something so different this time. I came at the first time, end of the day the last time and was really tired going into the Dream MAchine.
This time I was even more tired and was experiencing so many visuals. I’ve left the space extremely relaxed, not tired, just relaxed. Time was lost during these experiences.
"
"Some big “ washes” of solid colour. These scenarios are particularly relaxing.
Orange colour made me feel warm - like being washed out by the sun. More colours seemed to be in sync with the music. 
Experiences in the test session weren’t repeated into the main sessions.
Some colours (e.g purple) I did not experience at all.
Felt at times I was trying to be analyticals about the experience so that I could remember it. 
No sense of time included.
At one point I felt I was in the middle of a sci-fi movie!"
"Lots of sunlight and moving geometric patterns seen - lots of stars.
Moving material - looking like mountains or lava glowing.
A dog running in the distance.
Some faces-large eyes looking at time
People in the distance -moving but unable to see them fully.
Felt like an outer body experience - the light made me feel like I was in a different world and the experience totally brought me away from the real world. "
"I found I could not imagine real world objects or scenes the way I normally would (eg. a mountain) but when I focused on the shapes and colours in front of me I could impose reality upon them much in the same way we made faces and objects from clouds in the sky. At moments when the intense strobing subsided and (I presume) the large back light was on, I saw intense orange colour full of little biological shapes like “sleepers' ' we normally get.
When the intense strobing was on generally it had a focus point where it could prove it to."
Warm lights are mainly white and yellow followed by blue and white. Felt almost like a grid with a solar system moving clockwise across the back of the grid. I wanted to see more of the solar system but it almost wouldn’t let me. None of the other images had as much of an effect on me as that one did.
At first I felt like I was lying at the bottom of a swimming pool - I could see the light reflecting on the water. Then as the music became more intense I started to see what I can only describe as windows media player meets blade runner - so bright and vivid. Lots of symmetrical patterns everywhere. I felt like I was in a vortex. Then closer to the end of my experience I began to feel like I was running through a video game made up of giant cube. That was class.
"I started seeing stripes -like the view of the bottoms of a pool on a sunny day - this then developed into a sensation of spinning inside a vast space with windows to the outside world. I felt as though I could see trees outside the gaps in the walls of the space. I had to take down the mask when I started to see like I was spinning, eventually it came to feel like I was in a spinning tunnel of colours with the outline of 2 people spinning in the centre."
"A wave of colours, moving slowly then they intensify. Getting stronger and faster. At first I felt like I couldn’t experience it, like it was too much then suddenly a burst of red and blue, and I relaxed and felt safe and happy. I could feel such a strong sensation in the middle of my chest, I saw a small red spot in the centre of the colours, it gradually became a small foot, I could see our feet. Then suddenly a round ill and it cracked open and the foot was on the hill!! Then a large wolf appeared beside me, like I was looking down on top of its head as it stood beside me. Then it was gone. Only colour and waves. I felt filled with peace and love and happiness not wanting it to end! a glorious experience! "
"Womb like leaving from the inside - out molecules, inside the body, cells traveling through stars. 
Razor blades coming towards me, spinning lots of winged insects with stripes.
The feeling of stepping outside in nature and being able to breathe deeply in fresh air. Sometimes it took my breath away.
I’ve so quickly forgotten the amazing detail. I can only really remember the images I could relate to something I know.
10 minutes later everything else feels lost!
"
"A sense of relaxation, excitement and calmness. I saw swirls, crosses and shadows in the forms of people turning around in a circle. At times things felt fast and chaotic and at others calm, smooth and peaceful. 
There were multiple colours, red, blues, oranges, yellows, green, purples and pinks as well as greys, black and white. 
I felt as if I was moving with the patterns at times traveling fast through a tunnel or around in circles. A very unique experience that I would recommend trying."

"Unsure I was asleep at points, wonderful and strange at times I felt I was dancing leaping but landed on ankle and went to see colours of various shades. Dots in rows. Colours mainly purple/pink/yellow/orange but what stays in mind are strange blue (bright) disks. I thought what it must be like in the womb sound, possibly of light through the walls of whom and felt at some point body racing.
Amazing experience that leaves you contemplating how you experience life, falling asleep, sleep, point of conception, the brain, emotion.
Wonderful, thank you."
"Numerous kaleidoscope experiences but running at about 100mph towards a central part of the image. 
Also periods where shapes were rushing upwards. Just about every colour of the rainbow appeared at various times. When things went “dark” it was a different type of blackness each time - sometimes greeny-black, sometimes purple-black etc.
I didn’t feel anything other than amazed at how my mind could be seeing so many colours when it was only white light outside"
"*Be here now

"I was both underneath and high above everything. I was traveling down a long open road looking up at the sky and then I was falling through the clouds and huge patterns, towards the sea reflecting the bright sunlight. The sounds shaped the patterns as if the light was being distributed by hands or strange objects.
I was on a boat watching waves of light broadcast away from me and take me higher out. Visions explored from the centre with tiny supernovas which sometimes were faces of people I know. I saw mostly yellow and orange, until a green bomb exploded leaving red cracks and blue fireworks. White whips like laser beams.
Finally everything made way to a blue world, and it was the brightest, fullest blue I had seen so far, as if I had been pulled underwater. "
"I saw wide open spaces - vast beaches and forests -it felt like I was looking up at leaves and the branches of trees- often they were moving as if blown by twins but then they would still and sun would shine down.
I saw raindrops in pools of water and waves on a beach.
I felt intense heat in my eyelids even though I knew there wasn’t.
I saw lots of bright colours and swirling lights and stars 
I felt like I was floating but at the same time heavy and grounded to the earth."
"Patterns and colours I had never seen before. Strobes and movements that changes speed and rhythm. Veins and balls of colour. the orange, the most “orange” I had ever witnessed. Like seeing the inner - workings of my mind. When the light went dark there were almost always green veins. With light came shade of yellow, peach, orange, close to red.
There were dull blues and browns and purples mixed in more blurry shapes. Prisms in multi-pastels. It reminded me of looking through kaleidoscopes as a child. I began to daze off near the end, it was more difficult to focus. "
"Time went incredibly quickly. Multiple colliding colours -red, orange, blue in squares, triangles and other geometric formations moving towards central points, diverging towards the corner. Then  darkness filled with a line of blue forming aural - whirlpools type shapes moving from different areas.
I remembered an experience from my youth where I had a similar experience.
I felt some tension in my eyes in the intro. It got very calm, my eyes water a little.  Overall incredibly calm, safe, contained. I wonder if I did it again would I be able to see different things or what would happen if  it was going to kick off again when it ends - very cool"
"A phenomenal experience! So euphoric! Couldn’t stop smiling at certain points. It felt like being inside a James Turell installation but on steroids! Also felt like being inside a kaleidoscope. Patterns for me were very symmetrical. The experience started for me as if it was a rising sun… and then traveling through space at lightning speed. Colours would range from green/blue/yellow to incredible reds and peoples. And then suddenly darkness again but with incredibly intense blues. At the end of the experience and just before Elija “brought us back to the room” I felt my hands elevated off my lap, floating in space. Very strange but incredible experience!"
"There was such a huge variety of colours and shapes. It was very much a real kaleidoscope experience. Lots of diamonds all coming out of a central place. Sometimes there were three focal points in a triangle, sometimes it morphed to move. Sometimes it felt like I was finally moving. Sometimes the patterns started spiraling and moving and twirling. The other shape I saw a lot was a fat cube, well many, many of them.

In between parts were links to hundreds of pink veins intersecting. That bit was quite random. The patterns above were very specific. But the veins were random.
Also I saw a static TV screen at parts."
"It was like the end of 2001 space odyssey

"Saw pulsating colours - most frequent colours were red/pink and green. Swirling colours. Occasional shapes - squares. Felt like a kaleidoscope of colours. Eased to blues & greys as the lights dimmed. Sometimes colours moving towards me, sometimes moving away. "

"A feeling of wholeness, relaxation and peace. Very calm, comforted and safe."
"It felt like floating, being frawn upwards. Through different sphere and after-lifes, and perhaps what life feels like as it is ebbing away. "
"The colours I was seeing intensified how I was feeling, with yellow, I felt relaxed and at ease with red and black I felt quite anxious. "
"I have aphantasia so I didnt see anything but the colours, music and vibration were calming. I ended up falling asleep. "

Also V shapes and X shpaes

Warm lights mainly white + yellow then followed by blue + white. Felt almost like a grid with a star system moving clockwise across the back of the grid. I wanted to see more of the solar system but it almost wouldn’t let me. None of the other images had as much of an effect on me as that one did.

At first I felt like I was lying at the bottom of a swimming pool - I could see the light reflecting on the water. Then as the music became more intense i started to see what I can only describe as windows media player meets blade runner - so bright and vivid. Lots of symmetrical patterns everywhere. I felt like I was in a vortex. Then closer to the end of my experience I began to feel like I was running through a video game made up of giant neon cubes. That was class. 
The experience was amazing! I felt like I was always travelling towards a central force like through a tunnel. I seen many different colours merging in together like a kaleidoscope. When the music changed I saw a lot of geometric coloured shapes pulsing in time to the music that got smaller as they got toward the central force. I felt sometime like I was trvaelling through the galaxy with bright colourful fish like shapes dancing around me

"I had an intense happiness early on that made me smile and want to laugh
Later on most of the experience was like being in a huge changing kaleidoscope (not sure how to spell that!) … merged with feeling like I was traveling through space, through the universe, like in a sci-fi. I think the music has a huge influence on this interpretation (of space travel) because of popular culture/fiction/film etc. My mind wandered at times but mostly I was interested and attentive. 
There was a central point for most of this - it sort of felt centrifugal 
Periods of warm orange were intervals - like looking through closed eyes at the sun/on a very sunny warm day."
"I saw many colours and blocks and squares like a cityscape. Much of the time it was like a journey through space traveling forward. I saw cityscapes and then I liked trees and fractals.

The experience was paused as the staff checked I was feeling OK. 
It was a wonderful relaxing experience and reminded me that the perception of the world is often of our own making."
"It began intensely red, with no pattern, then this became deep orange. All of a sudden patterns of many different colours began to “resonate”, seeing to move out from a centre point which sometimes seemed like a tunnel. There seemed to be two patterns going at the same time, a pattern to the foreground and behind that another patterns which was made of lines and seemed sometimes to be outlines of buildings or structures. I saw a lot of honeycomb"

Surpassing because it felt very “normal” I felt normal, ordinary but I liked that I kind of knew it was subliminally not normal. I enjoyed being with myself in my own mind, not just completely relaxed thoughts

I have ADHD and started hard to quiet the mind but by the end it was focused trying to keep it focused!"
"To start with the intensity of the pattern, movement and colour were disorientating but will focus on breathing. I relaxed to a point of acceptance then completely phased out. My mind had lots of clear ideas completely unrelenting to the lights and the phased back to focus on the light patterns."
"A lot of geometric shapes and patterns which felt like they were exploding at me, with a central focal spot - like a light or dark hole as seen through a tunnel. Theimages tended to explode towards me but also change in waves. It was rather like looking through a kaleidoscope at speed."

I was spinning, recklessly, not scared I _____ are. I felt gliding through the ice, flying low I always feel here. Then I entered into a sunset ot sunrise that I just saw today. I felt the place was finally coming. Maybe. Hopefully at time i felt like leaving this world. Falling into the sleep trap. Because if you sleep you miss it. But I felt it, the one I didn’t have last night. 
I though I wasn’t on earth anymore but my favourite place too: the moon or some star shining thanks to her.

"Kaleidoscope of colour, bands of alternating and moving colours. The sound effect + crescendos, not too loud. I looked at the lights from time to time. Lots of snowflake type patterns. Glorious colours, moving away. Deep colours - red, blue, orange movingin and out of each other. Solid colour becoming multi-shapes."
"
A journey of sorts - at times I felt weightless
Soaring through a galactic space,and then down long narrow tunnels, which veered to the left \& to the right
It was a comfortable experience different snapshots popped into my consciousness throughout - an outline of a lady ( unknown to me in victorian dress), the top od a fortress and toward the end a very comforting sea of calm turquoise, like the ocean very gently moving
Throughout I saw geometric patterns repeated 
I liked the crescendo of the melodies matching with the movement of the lights & shapes.
"
"Orange - getting brighter + brighter 
Black & white honeycomb pattern
Tiny black & white checks with rainbow lines
Which started spinning to look like a bicycle wheel with spokes moving really fast 
(could only see ¼ of the broke wheel) which changed position & direction & kept getting faster until it was so fat it became on colours. 
At other times - patterns that lookwd like cracks in dry land/sand
Pattterns that looked like one colour with a painted glaze on the top (usually purples & tuquoises)
Mermaid scales.
Lots of red / orange 
"
"First of all I felt really relaxed, I could see some sots and spots according to the lights changing & the music. Some random thoughts were running around throughout my mind & ____ I concentrated on my breatething so I felt more relax & thought about the calm music 7 the lights flashing so that I was able to see some random pictures, dots forming some mountains or something. But apart from the daily routine & busy schedule it was really relaxing state of mind to increase concentration!"
"I felt like I could touch colours. 
They moved away from me and closer towards me then would change abruptly, the visuals made no sense to me and I saw an older man who looked like he was listening to me. I felt I was curious who he is and it took my concentration away from everything else. I saw many things going on around me with no limits and I felt weightless. I loved it. 
"
It was very reminiscent of an L.S.D trip listening to pink flloyd or other psychedelic music. Without the possible dangerous side effects. At time it was a beautiful experience of flashing and flowing coloured system ”relaxed” images. Perhaps it was inhibiting slightly. In a room full of strangers - and being unable to move around. Perhaps I should try the relaxed experience. 
"
Its not very easy to explain. It started off as an collection of colours & shapes and rapidly transitioned into 3 main things for me; 
An open eye staring into my head
A rabbit trapped within a prison of blood and water
The sun withering away/ fading into darkness.

I was so relaxed that I felt like I was floating but my feet still felt tingly. The colours and patterns were so intense but felt magical like I was travelling to a new dimension. Some of the patterns were so mathematical and geometric that I wouldn’t even be able to draw them without a computer it was one of the strangest but most beautiful experiences I have ever had 
"Patterns of colours I had never seen before. Strobes & movement that changed speed & rhythm. Viens & balls of colour. The orange, the most orange I had ever witnessed. Like seeing the inner-workings of my mind. When the light went dark there was almost always green veins. With light came shaes of yellow, peach, orange, close to red. There were dull blues & browns & purples mixed in more blurry shapes. Prism in multi-pastels. It reminded me of looking through a Kaleidoscopes as a child. I began to daze of near the end, it was more difficult to focus."
"Numerous Kaleidoscope experiences, but running at about 100mph towards a central part of the image. Also periods where shapes were rushing upwards. Just about every colour of the rainbow appeared at various times. When things went “dark” it was a different type of blackness each time - sometimes greeny - black, sometimes purple-black etc. I didn’t feel anything other than amazed at how my mind could be seeing so many colours when it was only white light outside. "
"
I kept seeing an eye - it was in the cenre of my focus always. It was still for most of the time but then it looked around. 
I saw lots of beautiful colours - like after moments of darknes a wash of once colour (blue, first then red, then yellow) before it would melt into several colours.
Lots of star shapes and XS crosses shapes.
"
"A sense of relaxation, excitement and calmness. I seen swirls, crosses and shadows in forms of people turning around in a circle. At times things felt fast and chaotic and at other calm smooth and peaceful. There was multiple colours, red, blues, oranges, yellows, green, purples and pinks as well as greys, black and white.
I felt as if I was moving with the patterns at time travelling fast through a tunnel or around in a circles. A very unique experience that I would recommend trying.

"Unsure if I was asleep at point, wonderful orange at time I felt I was dancing learping but landed on ankle and went to see in colours of various shades. Dots in rows. Colours manly purple/pink yellow/orange but what ____ in my mind 
Strange blye (bright) ____. I thought what it must be like through the walls of womb and felt at some point body racing
Amazing experience that leaves you contemplating how you perceive life, falling asleep, sleep, point of conception the brain, emotion Wonderful Thank you 
"
"Kaleidoscope of geometric patterns. I mostly saw the colour red. Sometimes with an intense pulsing of light, it hurt my eyes. Sometime I felt like an intense pattern was only starting to go black again. Feeling of movement, like travelling through a wormhole. Sometime a burst of little white lights. "
"Feeling of nervousness disappeared as you emerge into the sound and light appearing before your eyes. 
Drifting in and out out the space
Very therapeutic and calming though sometimes intense music brought more colour and lights in the imagery. Now feel very euphoric as I write this!
Thank you !
"
"
Sometimes the lights would make narrow bands or chequeur patterns, strobbing ot shimmering threads, and just as that was getting intense a ne wshape would roll in from no where, completely different, large and bottomless, astounding, the flashes front he threads and in turn illuminating the floor behind and beneath, a vast plain stretching out to a cloudy horizon 
"
"I initially, felt nervous but once we had done the ‘tester’ session I was fine. I saw warm light, followed by numerous different zooming and many sequences of colours. Zooming in and out toward a centre spot. I saw red, orange, purple, blues and whites. At times I saw tiny stars in the darkness. It is amazing what the mind can interpret from white flashing lights. Thank you love it. "
"Unsure if I was asleep at points, wonderful strange at times I felt I was dancing sleeping but landed on ankle and went to see in colours of various shades. Dots in rose. Colour is mainly purple pink yellow/orange but what sticks in my mind strange blue bright discs. I thought what it must be like in the womb sound, possibility of light through the walls of room and felt at some point body racing. Amazing experience that leaves you contemplating how you perceive life, falling asleep, sleep, point of conception the rain, emotion wonderful thank you"
"I thought the hot sun on my face on my feet in the water. They were often reflections of people and deeply personal experiences. Not visions no clarity. Just nods Feelings and events that are hiding in the corners of my mind. I wonder how colour can connect so closely with what is dormant in my consciousness without really referencing anything specific. Reds and oranges dormant followed by deep midnight colours.
"
"swimming with sunlight passing through seaweed forests
Cycling through Woodlands light draped cycling faster and faster
Sun bathing on the beach?
Happiness-imagining this may be what death may feel like-and emptiness yet for the feeling? Intense feeling peace nearly tears of joy it is okay, it will be okay
But then, suddenly-helicopters and fire gunshots? Death and sorrow and sadness and helplessness as everything was destroyed.
Last bit-new growth-green shoots from dark S but I was no longer connected
I was watching distant
end: sadness emptiness "
"Very meditative but stimulating. After speaking with a guide and being informed of the experience in advance was nice and also being aware of the other shows/experience on offer.
I am glad I chose this particular one. I was very impressed. Relaxing. The colours, set up with the tent, surrounding, furnishing all very interesting and comfortable. Surprisingly comfortable no complaints whatsoever. However having a pre-existing complaint. I would personally have like to lay flat on the floor yoga mat style but this is just personal to me.
"
"Nervous like I might hold back from seeing something. Lots of colours plus some shapes. I thought an eye, a brain, bricks from a wall being built plus some traffic from a Birdseye view.
Left feeling very dazed afterwards – not sure if my thoughts, like I need time to process.
Vivid and intense, sometimes like falling through space and time, every time I move my eyes everything followed me. Saw a tree with a lots of branches-no leaves…"
"It was like a kaleidoscope (unsure how to spell!) With lots of colours and shapes rushing by at the edges while something exploded or collapsed into the centre. At certain points I had the impression of seeing the night sky from space. Others felt like pixels on an old computer rushing by (or possibly something like chains on a bike.) Pink and orange were the colours I saw most often. The orange remind me of closing my eyes from the Sun. The pink felt like seeing the inside of my eyelids with the little veins-a lot like the flashback when getting a photo of the back of your eye at the optician.
"
"Even though I didn’t much close my eyes I envisioned (felt?) a fire burning a communal bonfire outside at night with people dancing joyously around it with wild abandon. Then they were in the ocean, naked, swimming, cleansing, cooling, refreshed and anew. Then it felt like sunbathing, warming-the Sun drying and enveloping. The remainder of the time I felt like it was rising, rising up with other beings around me rising too.

"
"Patterns of blue and red. Sometimes like I was passing through tunnel at speed. When the lights changed I do see green and blue in a very like pattern – very calm. I drifted off for awhile. I don’t know if I was asleep or in a deep state But I was less aware of the lights and sounds. I thought of some people, like my parents but nothing in particular. I came back to the room (still eyes shut) when there were some loud noises and lights-felt aggressive and sounded like a war zone with helicopters flying around. It was black and purple and was like I could see the strobe of the helicopter blades. I’d hoped it wasn’t the end as I’d missed a lot of it I think. The last bit was quite relaxing though but I felt deeply relaxed."
"
I had to leave after the trial period. Although the colours from behind my eyes were nice kaleidoscope and colour and geometric shapes, changing, glowing, mini patterns-the light felt too bright and I found it overwhelming. I became anxious Rather than at peace I wish my body had a relax differently plus relaxed into it to continue the colours. I __\_\ one amazing experience, unlike any other might try again"
"In the beginning I was in my mother‘s womb, and then was birthed flying through a tunnel of lights almost like space. I saw people purring at me from my peripheral. I did not recognise their faces but they were tall and lanky, with long faces. Zoned out halfway through, going back to memories from my childhood that I hadn’t experienced for years. I began to focus on my breath, which brought me back. As experience ended and the space became black my mind created the most favourite array of colours ever seen the whole time. The mind is an incredible artist."
"I had an intense happiness early on that made me smile and want to laugh
later on most of the experience was like being in a huge changing kaleidoscope (not sure how to spell that!)
… Merged with feeling like I was travelling through space, through the universe, like in a sci-fi. I think the music had a huge influence on this interpretation (of space travel) because of popular culture/fiction/film etc.
My mind one day at times but mostly I was interested and attentive.
There was a central point for most of this – it’s sort of felt centrifugal
Periods of warm orange word intervals-like looking through closed eyes at the Sun/on a very sunny warm day."
"There was such a huge variety of colours and shapes. It was very much a real Life kaleidoscope experience. Lots of diamonds all coming out of one central place. Sometimes there were three focal points in a triangle, sometimes it morphed to more. 
Sometimes it felt like I was definitely moving. Sometimes the pattern started spiralling and moving and twirling. The other shape I saw a lot was a flat cube, well many, many of them. The InBetween points were like hundreds of pink veins intersecting-that bit was quite random. The patterns of both were very specific. But the views were random. Also I saw a static TV screen at points"
I saw many colours in blocks and squares like a cityscape. Much of the time it was like a journey through space travelling forward. I saw cityscapes and then something like trees and fractals. It was like I was experiencing the neural structure of my brain. I felt an energy flow through my body travelling through my head and down my chakras. It cause the twitching and shaking of my body as the energy flows through me. This happens frequently when listening to music. The experience was paused as the staff checked I was feeling okay. It was a wonderful relaxing experience and reminded me that the perception of the world is often of our own making.
"
Womblike molecules, inside the body cells travelling through the stars. Rotor blades coming towards me, spinning lots of winged insects with stripes. The feeling of stepping outside into nature and being able to be, breathe deeply in fresh air. Sometimes it took my breath away.
I’m so quickly forgotten the amazing detail. I can only really remember the images I could relate to something I know 10 minutes later everything else feels lost."
"I could see what looked like pink lights all around then it was green.
Towards the end I felt as though I was moving backwards although I didn’t feel any emotion, it just looked as though I was moving away from what was in front of me, which just looked like a dark tunnel. Then it felt like I started to move forward again. I felt no fear, no emotion, just quite soothing Feeling that I was going backwards and forwards. I didn’t feel like I was walking/running or using my arms or legs at all to move in either direction. It felt as though I was only experiencing the emotion in my mind a bit like a dream!"
"At its most intense, the surety of intense colour, abstract shapes and 3-D rhythm was just mind blowing. Other sections resembled my imagined perception of what it would be like to be under a stormy sea with heavy lightning above. Are truly stunning experience set to a magical soundscape, like being in another world.

"
"
Each image was quite different I went to the only sound dream machine earlier and each experience was quite different. The other Was more like a meditation and I felt quite sleepy and almost drifted to sleep ( although at first my mind was racing + took some time to get into my body). This time though I felt really awake I really enjoyed the whole experience and didn’t feel overwhelmed at all my eyes were flickering from side to side and the images changed every time the brightness changed there were a lot of oranges, blue and red mostly. There are squares mostly crosses too
"
"If I like my eyes were open and the ceiling opened up, so we could see into the sky. We were stationary, but everything in the sky was moving/travelling towards us. Time is it for like I was looking down-and seeing a really long way. Like into space-sea and galaxies plus cities. Lots of reds and blues and yellows. A young girl with long curly hair appeared once and turn to look at me. Otherwise much more abstract!
"
"
It felt like my mind was attached to the little old window media player. As the music played kaleidoscope between. Black and white patterns open, (hounds tooth/hexagon/triangle) mixed with either warm red or cold blue/turquoise. Towards the end as the soft music came in the shape change to almost a diamond and feel like snowdrops in a flowery fashion and a mix of Royal blues and purples. Images were pyramids (multiple) and few_____popping in______ Kaleidoscope seem to be a common thing.
"
"One light bright lots of colour-red orange yellow pink as lights flashing changing, spirals with intricate shapes resting within and moving. Like flowers. ________________?
Other times as light darkend? More purple blue and green _____ Rectangle is coming out from a central point.
My brain would _____ go off onto transform thoughts about _____ in _____ I am ____or _____ I know then come back to the visuals"
"
Lots of suddenly and moving geometric patterns scene-lots of stars.
Moving material-looking like mountains or lava overflowing.
A dog running in the distance
Some faces-large eyes looking at me. People in the distance-moving but unable to see them fully.
Felt like an outer body experience – the light made me feel like in a different world and the experience totally brought me away from the real world.
"
"Fucking crazy. Story. Scary. Blissful.
Kundalini activation.
Meditative energy flow in my body and head and out. Reminded me of a really intense LSD trip. Laughter – just the amazement of life and my inner creation. Worried that my energy flow would be seen as epilepsy as they often shake and move spontaneously . Wanted to let this happen but afraid the guy to interrupt. Wanted to let my arms move and dance. Got more and more peaceful and wanted more and more. 
"
"
Lots of bright flashing colours and shapes turning from one designed to another very fast. Sometimes it felt like I was inside it and it’s covered my whole self. Then thoughts would come as I wanted to let myself go more I seen some fleeting objects one moment I saw a skeleton in a room of gold coins. I felt calm but still aware. At the end I seen bright orange and I felt I was travelling backwards inside a layer of the earths crust really cool!"
"
See: Patterns-geometric
Very bright aluminous colours-pink, peach, purple
Movement – circles, spinning, hexagons, waves

Hear: Chords… B-flat and C-major stood out the most. The fifth dominant of the chords the F sharp in the B Major – very emotional

Feel: I release… Sadness… The busyness of life and how I go go go all the time. I need for a pause, to reflect. The space provided that… Thank you!"
"My experience was primarily one of being in a three-dimensional fractal tunnel or tank. Shapes and fractal patterns in various colours crisscrossed my vision or created the feeling of travelling towards forward or backwards. At some stage as I saw images of being in a realistic staircase, of people and words structured prose. Of metal pipes. I heard people talking. I’ve no idea how long the experience lasted or if I was awake or sleeping for some of it it was enjoyable in its entirety; nothing about it wasn’t pleasant or uncomfortable. At times I thought I was holding something in my hands.
"
"
Thought maybe obstructed by the sound and disappeared quickly. The colours Evoked many feelings-a warm day – the sea flower is clouds
The staccato sound and red or deep colours sounded like a helicopter-resulting in slight alarm-heartbeat faster. Cool colours more peaceful and felt safe"
"
Beautiful beats and colours, beginning with fine white filaments, and colours emergent. I felt a gorgeous beneficent octopus in front of me in one early sequence. Underwater in space, lots of diffraction patterns. First the pattern is receding, then going, then I tried to merge and be with the pattern, and perspective exploded to one giant universe. Wonderful one pattern reminded me of a dream I had as a child of a current dream, that was more like a nightmare sometimes, since I was lost in it. It felt lovely to experience that pattern with pleasure now. There are rocks, rock concerts, probably to Jean Michel Jarre on the music! But still pleasure. One oceanic feeling was very sweet tempted.
"
"I saw lots of trees-blue, red, and mustard yellow colour. There were symmetrical patterns that shifted. When the flashes were intense, there was a central point and then has had diagonal wiggles. At some point it was very intense and thought I wouldn’t make it through, but then it calmed down and felt relief when it went black and had a white ring around it and felt calm. There were moments of elation when the patterns were exploring themselves and it felt joy in my chest. I felt very calm at the end of my eyes based in a lilac/purple. There were no definite shape, just lots of colour and movement kaleidoscopic static TV."
"I remember feeling a sense of well well-being at the beginning, a wave of joy came over me. I began to feel a deeper connection with myself; my personal domain was really ignited in my awareness. I love the transitions between the patterns and colours. I thought so I was alone, in a state of content, like I remember that I am not just part of a group, I am a unique individual with a goal and journey of a self exploration and self experience, this became more important for me to realise in that moment. I thought about the movie“lawnmower man” one point, that was funny. I am glad that the decision to attend was made. There was a few moments I remember thinking “wow “and “holy shit “. So that was nice I’d recommend.
"
"Light flashed at the start in a sudden bright white way. Then turned to mini dots and I saw colours-pink and yellow dots. It got faster and more intense. The colours merged into a blue and red and white  came again. I then saw black and white dots and the intensity of this increased until it felt like a rainbow.

I felt a sense of peace and calming. Being at one with myself and aware of my breath and where I was. It felt like a dream/trance
"
"Vivid washes of intense colour
Kaleidoscope images pulsating in time to the music with the image moving toward the centre, changing colour and flashing between colours and whole in the centre 
It felt a bit overwhelming at one point as I felt I was being drawn in to the centre of the whole book felt better and more able to relax after a break using the eye mask, then it felt like I was flying"
I started seeing dancing stripes – like the view of the bottom of a pool on a sunny day-this then developed into a sensation of spinning inside of a space with the windows to the outside world. I felt as though I could see trees outside the gaps in the walls of the space. I had to take down the mask when I started to feel like I was spinning. Eventually it came to feel like I was in a spinning well of colours with the outline of two people spinning in the centre.
"A wave of colours, moving slowly then intensifying, getting stronger and faster. At first I felt like I couldn’t experience it, like it was too much then suddenly a burst of red and blue, and I relaxed and felt safe and happy. I could feel such a strong sensation in the middle of my chest, I saw a small red spot in the centre of the colours, it gradually became a small fetus, I could see its feet and suddenly a round hill and it cracked open the fetus was in the hill!! Then a large wolf appeared beside me, like I was looking down on top of its head as it stood beside me. Then it was gone. Only colours and waves. I felt filled with peace and love and happiness not wanting it to end! A gorgeous experience. "
"Felt like I was pinned against the seat, trying to get away from the lights. Pure intense spinning circles and shapes. Bright blues and yellows-white and red. Firebreak. The colours in between of pink, purple or black were relaxing. Put my eye mask on near the end as felt I needed to stop. Pure hypnotic that you’re stuck to the seat where you can stop all leave at any time."
"Colours are mainly red/pink, blue and green in spirals or something like a wheel which appeared to show a continuous movement of numbers. At some point even resembled hieroglyphics? When the light was at its fullest it was like lying on a hot summers day on the beach, the colour dimmed. So grids of blue and black. Perhaps I slightly open, and saw an attic stone walls with uneven surface. Star symbols moving in and out of focus. I relax and experience without the drugs!"
"Can’t believe the amazing colours and how vibrant they were.
The amazing patterns, especially when the lights were flashing fast.
Did feel brain going into mummy mode a few times and thinking of all the things I needed to do today.
Did go back again into music plus lights. Did have an image of babies face as a 3-D Ultrascan image."
"Connection
Presents
Anxious – rose up throughout – had to breathe 
Very emotional, crying
Awareness heightened
Headache came on halfway-dull not distracting
Red coloured shapes, Spaceworld
Blue oranges white
Music and light lead soothing time
I felt my mum (past), a moment of time out, with no distractions
It was extraordinary, comforting, forcing me to be open and feel,.
Relaxing initially then a rollercoaster saw shapes connecting, moving and blend
I saw many colours orange red dark blue light green
The intense pulsing red was so emotive"
"I felt relaxed as it began. The breathing helped. At times I was still thinking of the outside and things going on. Then go back to breathing I seen slight colours starting with green then purple, light clouds in snow. It got dark bright.

Then I seen stars as if I was travelling through space which then was like I was lying on the ground in the dark or the light snow. Got dark again then bright.
"
"Travelling a lot. Down to normal and seeing objects in the distance.
Seeing babies in the corner of my eye and some people walking towards me. I saw lots of daisies and I is looking at me. I saw saw lots of stairs. Ar point I felt like I’ve I was in a room and the room kept getting wider and longer. It was a really awesome experience. Thank you!"
"towards the end I started seeing images on the oval screen above. They were quite similar to what I experience sometimes when I am very relaxed and about to fall asleep, when I see a sequence of faces (which I don’t recognise) flash before my eyes. With the dream machine I saw images but not so detailed. They were of the waters edge, apart with the sky above and see below an industrial image in front. I felt and I felt I could control the images (i.e. change them) to a certain extent. Very similar to the pre-falling asleep feeling I have."

"
I saw a lot of _____ light which felt like being in warm sunshine. This was interspersed with flashing shapes almost like a flower head in the middle. I did not find it easy to let myself go in the experience - which might be easier next time round. Heard helicopter sound toward the end before all went calm.
"
"It began intensely red, with no pattern, then this became deep orange. All of a sudden patterns of many different colours began to resonate, seeming to move out from a centre point which sometimes seemed like a tunnel. There seemed to be two patterns going on at the same time; a pattern to the foreground and behind that another pattern which was made of line and seemed sometimes to be outlines of buildings or structures. I saw a lot of honey comb type shapes like a lattice. I also saw fuzzy triangles moving outwards. If I scrunched my eyes tightly the colours would change dramatically and the colours were intense. The colours were mostly red, electric blue, green, white. I imagined it like a ston thrown into a pond and the circles would move outwards but they weren’t circles so much as kaleidoscope patterns and geometric shapes. I enjoyed the experience. The first short while was a bit too bright and intense but then I quickly got used to that and went with the flow. It was very relaxing but not sleep or too relaxing. Rather than feeling that the colours washed over me I felt I was moving towards them, as if diving into a multitude of paint pots with my eyes open."
I first started to feel relaxed and was cocentrating on my breathing I then started to think about worries I have about my family all the while tyring very hard to relax put my worries in a bag and float them away at times I was able to do this and go to a place I once was on holiday warm happy and relaxed at the minute. I’m feeling time and a bit more relaxed than when I came in. 
"
Shapes, relaxing, time. Lovely to stop and just listen, something I rarely do. 
The soundscape was reminiscent of a spa, a massage, a mediation or a yoga class it put me in the headspace of the experiences. I was v aware of the temperature of the light, the warmth of the reds, the cold of the blues. The time open in the Dreamchine gave me a pause in my sky to meditate on my thoughts and concerns, and think creatively, lightly about them.
"
At the beginning there was a clear _____ lighten than the others that I found myself looking for. As the sounds increased I felt myself being carried along. The ________ sound and drum beat had me tapping my feet and and then my fingers. As I enjoyed the best I found things changing and the noise become menacing and reminded me of a helicopter as it slowed I felt as thought it would land on my head. Then the sounds became easier and more distant and I was back again following the sound and as I listened I felt relaxed and the sound became re-assuring. 
"I can’t get away from the daily matters whilst listening relaxing in the music and environment that I were there however, I start feeling a deep sense of blessing for the current situation of the state of living where I can retire in this lovely country. Even the music, was growing stronger and draw my attention sometimes, I still have the blessed feeling around me. Very relax and comfort, don’t want to leave not because of I have to go back to ______ but it is just so comfortable and relax? Thanks God and everyone who taken me thru this experience!"
"There was a galaxy as if 3D in the background with the foreground appearing as if it was an electrical storm, sometimes with vibrant coloured mottled clouds, sometimes with bright lighting bolt coming down. All centred from a light at the top centre that sometimes appeared as an eye. Sometimes it was like a vibrant, colourful version of looking up a sunlight from under - water or through the dappled light of the leaves on trees. 
Thank you - the experience and glued breathing at the start were both amazing!
"
"Fantastic experience - felt as though my mind was being taken into a new dimension. 
At times the experience felt quite intense - colours became even more vivid and I felt as though I was seeing drawn towards or into something. 
I was amazed by the kaleidoscopic images my mind produced/created - like watching my own firework show. 
I was amazed by the intensity of the vivid colours & the variety of shapes / patterns I saw. 
Wonderful experience! Thank you 
"
"I found the divides / breaks to black most interesting. The intro single light reminded me of the devine feminine associated with DMT. I got lost a few times, thought of food, fighting raving anf the people I love. Blissful moments, lots of frenzy which created the breaks and mode the rest more intense. Alien vibes, future vibes. Healing vibes. Lovely."
"
Felt like I was on a roller coaster heading towards a trippy tunnel - so many gorgeous colours but nothing materialsed shape wise. I always had the tunnel ahead of me and I felt like I was flying into it. Brilliant experience! The music was so good and added so much to the whole experience. 
"
"A complete this engagement from reality. Very difficult to pinpoint specific images as they melted and vibrated into different depths and forms. Flashing geometry, circles, spirals, honeycomb colour, structures. All colours starting light white and various temperatures of white flashing through neon blues and greens. Images of people and faces. Undescribable timing. Difficult to focus on the images as so many dream scenarios Spurted off by the layers of images. A definite emotional release. It will take a while to work this out."
"Felt like a mix of spiralight? and Etch-a-Sketch. When the strobe came on and felt like I could see the cones in my eyes, when we went into darkness it was like the Etch-a-Sketch sweeping the colours and cones away. It was mesmerising to attempt to see my own colours and shapes."
"

Warm orange light-felt like a hot summers day. Red blue patterns like a kaleidoscope. Flashing intense lights and shapes-red and white like a flashing flowering pattern.
Then turn black with paint grey boxes. Then into green and black squares moving pattern.
When the flashes were intense you feel like closing your eyes. but they are already closed. Felt like you are travelling quickly surrounded by dots and shapes and light."
"During the taster I had intense fractal design is moving over consistent moving grids of colour. When the light became more intense, it was like looking into a clear, calm pool of water with light reflections.
During the main show, it was more geometric rather than the organic fractal shapes seen in the taster. I had a feeling of being in space with a structure forming around me. Always changing directions and both falling forwards and retreating away. "
Took a while to get into. Felt nervous at the beginning as the patterns changed-my breathing sped up. Felt more comfortable in main event. Lasted longer without eyepatch. I used eyepatch and found noise soothing – still felt sensations. Even felt vibrations. Went into meditative state. I felt really released at the end.
"
Weirdly I thought like I was in a temple somewhere in in rural southern Europe at sunset, but also as though I was drifting through darkness with an eye being my Lighthouse so to speak anchoring me in the darkness. It reminded me of Brian Eno and though that almost felt like I was in some dystopian film/episode of black mirror. Maybe similar to what we see you when we die as our eyes clothes on the line exposed retina slowly fades and a brain foods to slowly to Black."
"
Event Horizon
Dynamically being drawn to a horizon on the top and bottom planes. Sometimes the horizon would narrow to a point. Colours were dark green base with red shapes and simple tri-star shapes moving towards the horizon."
"
I kept seeing a cell travelling through an orangey pink space, possibly a vein or another galaxy. I saw visions from when I was younger (not entirely sure if the events actually happened). When the music became harsher, I reimagined a car accident I was in when I was four. The more uplifting music made me imagine two lovers hiking either in Italy or France and eventually finding a beach to dive into like a mirage.
"
"

A kaleidoscope of colours and shapes watching over me.
Pulsating geometric shapes
Red and pink of all varieties with starburst of blue sometimes shimmering like water on a summers day.
I wanted it to go on forever.
Sometimes too fast to see patterns but just watching over you.
Mainly in right eye.
At one point saw a silhouette of a man
Felt like it was coming towards me all like I was travelling through space "
I felt very relaxed I came straight home from a stressful day at work and was surprised at how quickly I felt relaxed. The sounds and lights made it easy to clear my mind and I focused on the sensations and weaving shapes and images that I could see. I felt different emotions and feelings of the lights changed.
"The flashing initially felt uncomfortable, and I found myself deliberately trying to distract myself with thoughts about work and other memories of today. Once I allowed myself to feel safe in the discomfort I began to notice shapes, leave, trees? Forest vibes. At one point I saw a figure with a backpack walking away from me. I also, very strangely, saw a man resembling Henry Hill at one stage?? Briefly, but he was there… The dark, thick glasses were the man notable feature. Sunlight and warmth (tangible warmth) felt in the beginning and ending. I also at some stages forgot to breathe - perhaps a sign of when I was most “in” the experience. The most calm I felt was when a pattern of green dots appeared"
"I saw endless corridors, filled with shamrocks that pulsed and spinned with purple light.
I saw shapes morph into things but centered around a cross, and they took the forms of a spinning sea God who was on top of the waves. I couldn’t feel my arms and felt like I was in sleep paralysis but it wasn’t unpleasant. I saw a newspaper paint and felt I was watching headlines of events and in the background I felt those events. "
"I felt absolute peace with the world - something I’ve not felt for some time. Vivid and moved colours, interviewing, swirling around me and racing me on a journey to…where?
I felt love and warmth, a sense of belonging and a feeling of overwhelming calm. 
Purples and reds, giving way to some greens and blues, interspersed with flashes and streaks of the purest, most brilliant white light which left me feeling powerful and strong.
I imagined departed loved ones and felt a re-connection to them. 
Now, as I write, I feel as one with the world and with life."
"I have a great sense of wonder and relaxation. I Wish I could travel more through these images. Geometric cheque boards of red, blue pulsating and changing in an impossible way, faster than I could comprehend. Not overwhelming at all, just fascinating and amazing. Sweeps of pink and orange slowing, growing and developing as if traveling forward. I felt warm and embraced. Wonderful soundscapes of music supporting a wave of positivity. "
"I felt as though I had been cast out into a vast unknown space filled with fractal patterns. 
I experienced a sense of gyroscopic movement as though I was rotting gently and at times accelerating then slowing down. I felt egoless for brief moments (reminded me slightly of some experiences with drugs).
I saw a huge array of colours and shapes in a wide array of movements like spinning horizontal/vertical, and some shapes increased and decreased in size. "
"Vivid colours rapidly change, becoming more intense with the music. Main colour was red but then every colour of the rainbow was seen at some point. Lots of grids and lines. Geometric small moons and triangles. At the end it felt like the colours were moving towards me from my feet to my eyes. I could differentiate between what was seen in each eye separately. I felt like most of it was mainly on the right eye."
"I felt anxious, like I didn’t know if I should continue, very intense colours, extremely vivid colours. I actually felt emotional, almost upset at one point. Seen what I can only really describe as fractal patterns. One big constant I saw, was a glowing orb that shifted colours and followed my eyes wherever I moved them in my head. It would come and go but was constant."
"Amazingly detailed repeated structures, sometimes square tiles, sometimes hexagonal ( like a honeycomb)
Often the colours alternated between every other tile on successive flashes.
At some points it reminded me of the title sequence of the original Dr. Who, or the multiple-image effect using a similar technique in the Bohemian Rhapsody video but in stunningly high saturation colour (again the multiple tiling theme repeating over the whole of my view) 
Another repeated-structure theme, new the star, was similar to the radiating rows of decorative “bosses” on the inside of say, a cathedral dome. I was fascinated by how detailed some of these repeated structures were.  
Near the end I became aware of the whole view spinning clockwise, but almost as soon as I noticed it that seemed to cause the spin to stop and reverse to anti-clockwise."
"In the beginning, a soft glow of pink came into my vision and I felt soft. I imagined myself as a baby in the womb and how calming it was. As the experience progressed, my visions became more intense and vibrant: swirls of colours bursting across my mind. I felt as though I was zooming through the universe but at the same time it felt so peaceful. I was moving towards a paint of rainbow colour before it would disappear and new patterns and colours would replace it. I felt fluid, happy to move with the pace and patterns. I feel different coming out of the experience, a new yet familiar feeling of understanding
Thank you :)"
"At first I was trying to analyse everything that I was seeing or feeling with a change in music. My mind kind of changed into a different mode and shapes started to show up. I saw a grid made out of triangles that shaped and evolved into different things. 
From the brain it zoomed out and built a landscape. I recognize the landscape from a trip I took with a friend hiking at the north coast. I thought of the animals we saw that day and in that second a red flash happened through the picture. Like a bunny we saw that day just dragging behind the air. I though this was real and in that moment the landscape and scene morphed again compelling into shapes."
"Didn’t really visualise when inside the room other than the ceiling feeling like an eye and the feeling like we were under the sea in a submarine looking up into the ocean.
The sound was calming but then interesting when you felt it travel around you."
I saw a red rose like flower opening and then a jellyfish-like red object moving like the capillaries of my eyes. I also saw a laughing Buddha’s outline expanding and checkered patterns and flowers like that on a wallpaper. It was a very happy experience to see the inside of a womb like how I must have seen it when in my mother’s womb> I also saw the sunlight like it was a bright day but without the heat. Towards the end a brain scan image popped up in my head. I felt peaceful and wanted to continue the experience. Overall recurring theme was flower petals opening and colour exploding like it does when mixed in water. 
"I felt safe, happy, content. My mind settled and let the experience happen. 
I imagine it lasted for a while but it felt like 5 min only. I felt I could have stayed then for hours and hours. 
I would love it to become a permanent fixture in Belfast. It brings peace and relaxation and can only imagine benefits for mental health. This was my 3rd time in High Sensory and each was different and similar in some ways.
Today was the most peaceful I ever felt.
I just hope I will be able to experience this again as this is the only few times in my life when my brain quietens down, slows down, I’m finally at peace, not thinking (overthinking) happy, safe and relaxed. 
Thank you for bringing it to Belfast."
"At first, a series of kaleidoscopic patterns, with brief intermediate trips standing through space and deep under the ocean. 
A few pauses in the middle to bathe in a sunlit field.
A few euphoric moments where it all “clicked”
The end where I was under a landing helicopter.
And a few moments where it was all too much and I chose to sink back to darkness, away from the adventure."
"I saw oranges and yellows which were calming and gentle, as the lights intensity increased and flash I saw shapes mostly coming from a central space and I sar colours ranging from yellows to reds, hexagons, letters and numbers. 
As the intensity increased I felt uncomfortable and would prefer an experience which was a series of gentle changing light much like the start. The visuals and light became quite jarring for me and I left the room. I feel spaced out and experienced some dear in the Dream Machine, I enjoyed the gentle music and the gentle start."
"My attention was often drawn to the centre where there an eye shape, and all the coloured patterns around it would vibrate and oscillate… then while I felt my body relax the patterns would relax and “I” would fall through the eye and the entire canvas of patterns and colours would transform as I flew through it. "
"Euphoric, relaxing, I felt the shapes (like the outlines of people) were passing past my peripheral vision half moons. 
Colours were mostly oranges, teal, blue, and reds. 
I thought initially I might feel more comfortable but instead felt extremely relaxed. 
Real life kaleidoscope. Thank you. I haven’t breathed  a slowly and smoothly in 
quite a while ."
"I felt like I was back to a primordial human existence -high up in a brightly green leafy tree, high up above the canopy of a thick tropical forest. It was a sunny morning, and the tree and air was damp from morning dew. I was at peace and relaxed."
"movement, shapes, forms, blips of colour moving fast and slow. Entities of different natures gliding between each other. The shapes all behaved differently and came with their own unique energy like chapters in a book or scenes in a movie. It mimicked the music. It was beautiful."
"I felt immense happiness and then sudden sadness, very _____, sadness really. The happiness was linked to the bright lights. The sadness was linked to the realisation that blue colours must have been what my younger cousin saw before he drowned in the sea. They were both very powerful emotions played out on the lid of the eye stage!"
"I felt that I was in the moving towards a point, it was very colourful but filled with bubbles of all different colours but only two colours at a time. Eventually I don’t remember, but the sound resonating through my body made me feel very relaxed. Tried to continue with the breathing which then reignited the visual experience
But very relaxed and elating"
"My second visit very different. The first time was a visually overwhelming, music and colours synchronising in the form of geometric shapes with hard edges. This time was more spherical, orb like shapes, less intense only occasionally breaking into high contrast geometric shapes.

The sense of constant movement-changing, convoluted-sometimes like spaceships reforming the shapes.
The same sense of having a panoramic scan in near space just beyond reach. I used to feel this way, of the space as a screen when I eyes closed much more as a child.
I want to keep coming back to this-like being a Psychonaut, a Traveler in in a space( cheesy , sounding , I know ! ) 
"
"I saw bright, contrasting primary colours drawing towards me and then pulling away. In honeycomb shapes they evolved into different patterns. As it progressed, the pattern became more abstract and the shapes merged and blended into each other. At times, it was colourless grey. Like a blurry black and white photograph. I pictured a textured wallpaper. I also at one points or something that resemble the galaxy of stars.


"
"The initial feeling was one of peace, sunlight, then as it grew more intense it was like a shot of energy that felt very uplifting. The colours were so bright and intense. At one point everything shattered into hundreds of blue stars. Behind all the geometric shapes, patterns and colours I kept seeing the silhouettes of the top of the trees as though driving fast beneath them. In each moment I couldn’t help wondering what everyone else was seeing how similar/different it might be!!"
"For most of the experience, I saw kaleidoscopic a arrays of moving or pulsating colours (yellow, blue, white, red, green) . At one point I saw George Best (as he appears in the cover of the wedding present album) and towards the end I saw a dual crown, negative image of myself, as I was sat in the dream machine.



"
"Initially found it hard to disengage and let myself be immersed in the experience. After a few minutes though I found it easier to let myself go and eventually, physically, I felt weightless on occasion. Visually I saw a lot of patterns, pixels, squares and at one point spirals. The Experience was very colourful very psychedelic.
Afterwards I felt slightly dizzy and disorientated, but this pass quickly.
"
"At first it was a dark orange/yellow colour but then happy music sounded I could feel and think and the yellow went lighter, I could see my wife dancing in her wedding dress. The music got darker/eerier and I could see an open door with the darkness within it, I couldn’t go inside. It went dark I felt like I was controlling a video game character and tried to climb the stairs. Darkness again, there was blue spirals for a while then I saw a luminous blue jellyfish that looks so real swimming in front of me and I tried to reach for it but it disappeared.
"
"Colour/space/movement
Out of body, out of mind
Geometric, pink, green, yellow
Joy, contentment, acceptance
Moving, spinning, no boundaries
No edges no barriers, no end
Infinity of thoughts and feelings
Patterns creating and recreating forever
Restful and reflective expansive, expanding exploring going forward, backwards and beyond
 "
"
It was an intense experience with many different visuals. At the beginning it was very symmetrical and uniform shapes and colours. Either a continuous pattern or a spiral or a centre shape. Towards the end the visuals became more specific. I saw a toadstool with eyes. Various creatures and different plant life, but it was all animated. I did manage to get totally lost in the experience and despite the brightness at times it was very enjoyable experience. I also noticed that when I squeeze my eyes I could change the colour of what I was seeing."
"I felt like I was trying not to die. The lights I could see where I was inescapable. I didn’t not like them, I felt like I was in fight or Flight mode and my body wanted to run away but my brain told me to stay. The colours were intense. I was thinking a lot about how I will remember this for the rest of my life. It reminded me of a past scary experience which made me scared but I kept telling myself I was safe and did the breathing exercise."
"I had no feelings, I feel like I couldn’t feel anything I was just in the moment and couldn’t process any emotion. I felt like I was in the moment but also not. I felt intense. Intense is probably the best to describe. Felt anxious after. The colours were my favourite part. Colours and shapes made me feel calm but the moment didn’t."
"I seen quite a lot of geometric shapes and patterns. A wide variety of colours and strange imagery. I seen three people repeatedly walking past me, I seen a big black and white eye opening up, I seen red and blue checks that almost look like TV Static.
I also seen what I look like someone flipping playing cards.
"
"
Kaleidoscopic blues, purples, oranges, quite overwhelming at times. I didn’t see anything that was solid or seemed “real “, but I had the impression that there was something larger and more complex happening behind a kaleidoscope. But I couldn’t quite resolve. Intense and may be a little sinister! I got distracted by the music eventually – the effect of the light frequencies at the loudest parts-vibrating ribs!-Was really pleasant "
"Vivid colours – blue, red-pink and green geometric shapes. Fractals. Several layers moving across each other at different speeds. Pulsating, vibrating centre-like moving through a portal. One occasion of seeing static objects-three or four behind the moving layers. Green networks-like neural connections/electricity-van der Graaff generator."
"Started off slowly with very bright white light. Different colours gradually came in different shapes getting more intense, then going back to white light like that cycle _________ then seem to repeat but with a different colour being more prominent in different shapes. The main colours for me were orange blue and red."
"

Lots of intense bright light changing frequently. Shapes evolving, a long tunnel that looks like a ship floor?? (Strange I know)
I felt relaxed and anxious at the same time if that makes sense.
I tend to overthink everything and this is why I pulled the mask over twice, as I found the impact and intensity of the colours and speed too much midway through.
Overall an amazing experience thank you"
"I felt warm, I’d like the sunrise was happening at regular intervals… When that happened I wanted to breathe more deeply and I felt totally at peace. After that it felt like gradually taking flights and then as though the universe was zooming towards me,_______ Sometimes in the spiky geometric shapes (sometimes almost letters) and other times in 3d grids I felt I was moving around and through, and still other times in organic shapes – mountain peaks rising and falling away, trees bursting into bloom and disappearing. Towards the end I saw rippling water and felt as though I was floating in the shallow part of a beach."
"A journey into the past people I haven’t seen or thought about for yeats
A sensation of moving, on a train
But sometimes a feeling of tranquility 
downwards
"
"At the beginning it seems kinda scaring, the flashing lights and the music reminded me that how I perceive the world is different since I have autism, but then I realise how unique everyone and everyone perceive the world in their own way. I felt connected with my mind like Ive never than before I felt like being alive"
"Sometimes just one colour
Then sometimes pulsating colours usually red & green
Squares ascending towards me
Pale colours whites, blues, orange sliding away from me slowly 
Very relaxing even though it could feel intense felt as though I was drifting off to sleep but was wide awake at the same time. Didn’t feel like you wanted to leave
"
"see -3-D and 2-D forms shapes patterns a cylindrical tube small but going into distance with a curve small curve like ———- tube but ———— I wanted to explore and go down also saw a man in black for a short time

Think - it was like listening to loud music in a dark room with the fire lit, stepping outside of yourself although silly thoughts about music or the music losing concentration on what was happening and drifting off"
"Slightly unsettling at first when the striving started but I settled into it. The visuals changed constantly-some seemed vastly distant, others sat right in my eyes and through my head. I looked up at Kaleidoscopic effects and down on galaxies. When the sub-base started on the music the visual change was so sudden I actually laughed, I saw the bass ass wobbly green lines. Some visual seemed to be on a 2-D plane others 3-D. Some were moving in front of me, others I was moving through. It ended too soon"
"I always think about life and death, they don’t exist. There is only energy keeping transforming, when we think we are going to die we are just going to be another part of the universe. During my session I felt that I was energy, not a human being. We just exist from always too forever.
"
"block colours of yellow fading to orange and red, sudden transition to grey occasionally usually black then back to red. Rippling curtains of blue and the lines of electric blue flickering in between. Reminiscent of butterfly wings or Lawrence flow diagrams. Cross pattern transitioning to grids grids diamond pattern, visually orange and red with flex of green. Occasionally ring patterns usually with ————-
Occasionally darker structures at the bottom of any field of view. Trance like, loss of sense of time at the end-didn’t realise the session was nearing its end.
"
"Lots of chequered patterns moving from large to small, sometimes expanding from a centre point sometimes uniform. With dots in random squares. An orb moving, mostly staying on the right hand side. Movement around the peripheral edges of these chequers that disappeared if I tried to focus on them, like headlights speeding around a track. Blobs that look like bacteria under a microscope."
I was apprehensive at the beginning. The bright light was intense and I felt a desire to open my eyes but at the same time I wanted to keep them closed as the patterns I could see were so intriguing. The intensity continued for a while butas the experience went on I began to enjoy it more. The patterns and shapes flew past my eyes like wild Japanese space Invader video games. The breaks in intensity we welcome. But I gradually enjoyed the patterns more and more. The music and the breathing exercise helped me to calm me down. The feelings I received were similar to that of a nightime concert where I felt at one with the light show and the music. 
"
A blast of red light, which turned into a burnt orange. A spinning black hole open in the centre with red and white spirals emerging, pulsing from it. I felt myself swept focus, I felt as if my body spun inside down and then ______itself. I shot down into the hole at hyperspeed and then was sucked back in, this continued for a while. As if I was caught in a wave. Once I left the red I emerged into a blue moving space.
"
"

Beautifully relaxing……
I periodically opened my eyes, the silver colour was beautiful, like a huge harvest moon. I really enjoyed the very dark, enjoyed that most, with the sound vibrating. Each time as the real dark receded back to light I felt as if I was floating, and moving slowly and gently like a mantra, just gently gliding and floating. I saw a little kaleidoscope of colours behind my eyelids as the room darkened. Overall a very very relaxing wonderful experience."
"A lot of it was kaleidoscopic, as the lights changed the movement of the colours would change-sometimes moving towards me, other times around clockwise or counterclockwise. There would sometimes be recognisable shapes, hexagons or triangles, other times it was like looking into a petri dish, or like images of clouds and Jupiter, swirling.
"
"Vivid colours rapidly changing becoming more intense with the music. Main colour was red but then every colour of rainbow was seen at some point. Lots of grids and lines geometric. Small moons and triangles. At the end it felt like the colours were moving towards me from my feet to my eyes. I could differentiate between what was seen in each eye separately. I felt like most of it was mainly on right eye.
"
Didn’t really visualise when inside the room other than the ceiling feeling like an eye and feeling like we were under the sea in a submarine looking up into the ocean. The sound was calming but then interesting when you felt it travel around you.
"
It felt like I was moving through this tube-like pull in space. And I had a split second thoughtsvisualisation of me sitting flying through the wormhole-like-tube with many colours and the lights at the end. I also have a few mental health conditions that cause dissociation and hallucinations. So I felt a common feeling I’ve had when dissociating, when I feel like I’m floating rolling forwards without ever feeling upside down. I felt very far away from my body especially my hands and feet. This was a nice safe controlled environment, so I was fine experiencing that feeling."
"I seen redcoats racing past, an officer on a white horse. I felt 1650 age wise. As the sound got louder I seen an enormous steam train speeding front past. I also seen a peasant man. Who had an arm blown off. The star I was flying around the universe like a little fairy enjoying it."
"The deep listening experience felt like I was being elevated out of my seat, Whereas the high sensory experience felt like I was sinking into my seat. I felt shivers all through my body in the deep listening and felt very relaxed throughout and afterwards. When the lights dim down, I saw circles closing in on each other of different colours. It was mesmerising. Thank you for another wonderful experience! I would recommend both experience to everyone."
"
One of the memories is seeing a distant eye that starts to spin fast, but I could always see clearly the pupil. I was pretty nervous in the beginning. I really like the setting of the room and calm voice of the instructor. I saw bright colours from bright yellow to intense purple and strong blue and green. I saw a sunset over the desert squares on the blackboard. I think I fell asleep when I was spinning, but when the performance was finished I felt really relaxed.
"
"

Big orange sun
I felt expensive like the space was endless, then plunged into darkness that was total. At times I felt it was getting close to being overwhelming, but never went over the edge-like the different shapes to the flashes-some hexagonal-some stary
that overall effect though is calming"
"I saw a mixture of patterns, sometimes showing together and sometimes shown separately. The patterns were kaleidoscope like sometimes and sometimes they were ripple-like. Often they would be dots or sometimes even star like. When the music changed the images that I saw match to the rhythm of the music. You did feel like you were in another universe and that you did not want to return to reality LOL.
The colours that I saw was sometimes red and blue, pink and green, blue and black; sometimes even multicoloured. The images that you see are mesmerising. It was an unforgettable experience
PS sorry if I spelt kaleidoscope wrong (I guessed)
"
"
I saw kaleidoscopic of geometric shapes in orange yellow blue and red. Intense visuals heightened by a complete fade to black with blue interference-like images. The excellent music really added to the experience. I felt extremely relaxed and happy throughout the experience and it very much lived up to my expectations. I would recommend this experience to everybody. I am amazed this was free and I am grateful to all involved in making this a truly unforgettable event. Thank you!
"
"I felt like I was _____ into a warm light. A calm washing over me. I became very aware of my hands and that I was a person who could watch the patterns, but I still I had a body – I wasn’t just a floating eye. I kept seeing people in my peripheral vision. Almost as if I was walking down Princess Street and trying not to trip over strangers as I was floating following the patterns."
"Initially, I had the sense of sitting at the window seat on a train. The train was moving through a wooded area and was accelerating. This then transitioned into a feeling of running. Running fast but feeling very strong and breathing easily despite the speed - euphoria almost. This passed quickly and I felt like I was scuba diving (although I have never done this in real life!) the second half of the session felt like I was flying - not in a plane but actually flying. I felt wholly in control and safe despite being afraid of… "
"At first, there was a sunrise, very bright, warm & reassuring. There there were patterns in waves of different colours, meeting in a sphere-like ball of ‘energy’ that remained in the centre of my vision until the lines crossed through it diagonally, at which point the ‘vision’ changed entirely to take on a semblance akin to a kaleidoscope for a while. Though what I could see was constantly changing, the experience was generally like seeing patterns of moving energy in different colours. There were two moments at which I felt physically warm, though not uncomfortably so, I felt as though I was a little off balance at three points - two as though I had tilted slightly to the right and once to the left, though again not comfortably or jarringly so. At the latter stages of the experience, particularly as I relaxed further and further into it, images aking to a grey pencil or charcoal sketch began to form, as though superimposed over and at the same time behind, the moving waves of coloured ‘energy’ that posted the majority of the experience and, even though I could not make out what these sketches were of, I found the fact that they had appeared and, in a sense, ‘existed’ to be very reassuring in "
"Close to fall asleep and few times, which was nice. My imagination was close to a space excursion to unchartered areas. There were no unpleasant moments. The ambient music fitted well to the flashing lights. The very loud part of the experiment gave us the nicest reflections, together visual effects and sounds, as they were the most unexpected, soft, delicate, complex, tiny elements, embracing your mind. I thought there would be more elements at the very end, however after a few minutes (now I’m writing this I notice) I think the experiment ended at the very good stage leaving some space for more expectations in the future. 10/10 "
"Very psychedelic. It felt like you were in a 3d room full of shapes and colours and kind of just floating in between all of these. I don't know how long it was, but it felt both like an eternity and a few seconds. At some point more than just colours, and morphed into something you could recognise, but couldn’t quite tell what. The teaser, the very beginning was the most out-of-the-mind experience I could feel. It felt like I was someplace I knew, but couldn’t quite recognise it."
"It’s a really extraordinary experience. I’ve ever had. At the beginning i see just black when the light first started to turn up i saw mostly orange starting from the middle like the sun. it looks burning. And when the light turned dark again i started to see different patterns. Little cubes of different colours. Mostly orange and blue subes moving really fast sometimes its like waves. Sometimes swirls. When i start to get used to the light i begin to think about things my daily things. I start to not feeling the lights and all the patterns, my attention was drawn to my “memories”? I am not sure. I believe this is the most “dreamy” part of this experience. I feel like i began to “see” my memories or… [missing]"
"It was amazing how easy it was to relax in an area with loud noise. My body completely relaxed relatively early whilst my mind kept buzzing with outside activity. When i concentrated on using only my hearing i completed relaxed. When the loud relaxing music changed to more alien like music it was awakening - not so chilled and relaxing also the room felt colder. It felt more like waiting to leave to go somewhere. When the music then changed to quieter the room felt warmer again but the vibe was not as relaxing as the louder, stronger music. The experience of colours whilst relaxing was not very strong overall but the deep black of the void as the loud music was really strong and unusually comforting. There was a lot of energy movement around my feet and hands and with the hands it was external towards me as well as internal out. I preferred to keep my eyes closed as it was more relaxing… [missing]"
"See - colours, kaleidoscope from childhood. I also was reminding of lying in long grass as a child facing the sun - feeling the heat on my face and pink/ red behind my eyelids. After a little while I felt as if I was travelling forward being propelled along and invited into a more and more pretty landscape. The music changed to me more staccato sounds and I was pushed backwards quietly and my mind raced to remember what I had seen. When the music settled I was in a darker place with a slight red flow. Here I realised I was breathing into my back ribs. I spend a lot of time as a shallow breather and I realised I was totally relaxed now and in a state of bliss. I rarely reach this place even in yoga practice. The music is lovely and just feels safe and comforting. Most vivid is the colour purple I saw. "
"A cascade of black ‘x’s outlined in white flowing from the top to the bottom. There was also black and white static that felt like it was flowing in a certain direction but everytime if focused the flowing nature of it just stopped. Only once or twice i saw either a pair of eyes or an eyeball it didn’t have any expression. By the end i saw a bit of colour; pulsing blue lines on the edges of an otherwise black expande, and very subtly some hints of orange, yellow and red, but once i noticed them their either faded or moved out of my eyeline. I felt relaxed by the end, all thoughts pre-machine left once the experience started. I did feel like there was someone else in the room while it was happening but it could just be my paranoia. I could not tell you how long the experience lasted, it coud be 5 minutes or an hour. "
"Loved the soft rising and setting of the sun as colour slowly glowed and darkened moving around my vision - very soothing - would have loved to experience the warmth of the sun at these intense moments. 
Felt like being in a kaleidoscope with the constant shift/ change of patterns/ colours. Sometimes i felt like i was flying or should i say rocketing through space away from earth, though at one time it felt orange organic “stuff” was flying at a terrific speed towards and past me - not unpleasant as such. Other times i felt i was at a fairground going around so fast - head and stomach spinning but like when you’re drunk - not so pleasant!!!

Felt the flashing lights a bit manic - but loved the experience after when i was dropped into darkness and the most subtle shifting darker colour and patterns more soothing - a bit like the crazy demands of daily life when they become too much - an overload of the senses and then you are dropped into peace and quiet - delicious!!! Not sure if i dropped to sleep near the end of these moments - or just in deep relaxation. 

Felt eyes or eye lids flickering at some moments, almost like when in hypnosis. Also at some stage i had a flash of an image that came towards me and then away - almost a black inked outline sketch of a horse and rider. Faded away into the kaleidoscope of colours and patterns again. 
Wondering if this is telling me the therapeutic importance of a trip to visit my family not only for my mum to go back to her home place but also for my son to spend time at his cousins equestrian - to be surrounded by horses. "
"There was bright light, like a blinding summer day, so bright I was scared to open my eyes and look directly at the sun. colours changed into a vivid orange. Behind the lights to me periphery it looked like building or animations of the type youd see in old rock videos of constant … in a circle at the centre. I was thinking of a person I know, who is near death. The feeling transition was ever present which due to the lights or my subconscious, I cannot say. I was tired today, it was mesmerising, a step outside the ‘normal’ "
"I did a drawing on my first go, so here’s some text… ive heard of free radicals tiny hairs that float on the surface of the eye’s moisture, I experienced them in Murrayfield Park lying back staring up into the sunlight puring through the trees. The Dreamachine and such, highlight the movement of these fibers. 
Amongst the shapes - geometric, pulshing of spirals, explosions from out to in and more in to out explosions, a starsweeper screensaver, travelling through spare, also a startling show of falling, and occasional scary faces that jolted me out of a relaxed, almost sleepy state. 
I cheekily looked at the participants as I am nosy and at the lights with open eyes, how the feelings are better with eyes closed. 
It's as close to meditation as I've been without guided instruction. This isn’t a flippant remark (and I realise there are legal consequences) but allowing the experience with recreational drugs before might allow some people to separate themselves from their own ego. 
Perhaps a coded encouragement to audience members, especially those in government, the civil service - to encourage them to loosen up a bit. 

In summary, it's a modern child’s kaleidoscope but unlike such it has exactly geometric, I was supposed at the presence of only white light, because I saw colour. "
"Lots of flashing, felt like I was floating through a time machine tunnel, those similar to ones we saw in movies. Felt like floating from one end to another. And when I reached the tunnel it was like opening a door to a whole white empty space. Felt like spinning around the entire time, I did have some minor headache, but it was okay, not too bad, felt like being paralysed felt not completely grounded. I thought it would make me think about the past or something in ‘real’ world but I experienced geometric shapes. Also, these were points when i saw dots spinning around, felt like being in the universe with green stars and nothing else. At the beginning, it was interesting that I could see the people in the opposite row. I thought I was opening my eyes but I wasn’t. They appeared like a blurry picture infront of my eyes. I tried pressing the eyelids thinking that my eyes were closed now. But the images appeared again - so 2 times. And they spinned my thoughts as well. Surprisingly it was very calm. "
"I felt as though I started off in the clouds and different shapes and colours of the rainbow kept coming my way. The room went dark and then it was like I was looking at objects under the microscope. I mostly saw triangles and then rainbows. It was quite intense in some parts too many different shapes to draw each one down on paper. It was like watching a moving gallery of all different forms and like I was completely disconnected from the world, like an out-of-body experience. I also saw a glass tall pointed building almost like being in a lamp with glass that people could look into but I was in the inside, it was beautiful, the most beautiful mostly consisting of purples, navy and black. Beautiful but almost fragile like, overall, my wildest imagination watching my own wild thought in front of me. "
"The closest thing I've ever experienced to DMT without DMT. a limitless number of fractals growing infinity. Spirals, fireworks, spikes, morning stars, blue and red and blue and red, static, again and again. Then I would fall away from the visuals into a dream space - like the chaotically mundane dreams that come to you early in the morning, in between alarm snoozes and naps on long train journeys. At first, I found the light very bright and intense, and my body would flinch in reaction, but then after the taster, my body relaxed, and I floated away. "
"Initially anxious, felt as i settled into it i was excited to see what was happening before closed eyes. I saw kaleidoscopic colours and multiple geometric shapes, however the main remaining recognisable image that sticks in my mind is that of eyes. The soundscape helped to give the feeling and perceptions of being in a dreamlike state and flating to another dimension. I also saw clouds but mostly abstract images. over all the experience was fantastic and I will… [missing]"
"I felt anxious when I first sat down as I didn't know what to expect. During the experience, i felt slightly dizzy and a sensation of spinning to multiple locations in my mind. I seen many shapes, followed by stars and the feeling i was travelling through space. The images behind my eyes were moving at such a speed it was hard to distinguish them. Often I seen multiple colours moving and flowing and returning back to a bright light. When I seen the brightest light my chest felt like it was expanding and I could breathe in deeply. When I reflected on the experience while still in the dreamachine, I started to see blue binary code. It was overall very interesting. "
"I zoomed in and out from black holes to points of light. It seemed like at times I was viewing the universe in the night sky; at others it seemed like I was looking at the matrix in which everything is held. I felt i understood the inspiration of the designs of the mosque in Mashhad. It seemed like I was under a teal and red coloured xxxx. A perfect hexagon. Those xxxx morphed into my travelling again, moving to and from the black holes and the dark and light. 
I made a note to myself to check what astrophysicists mean when they refer to the ‘singularity’ 
I wondered if I was being in the universe and I wondered if the sound and light was like the experience of death. I hope I would see my mother but I didn’t. I am left thinking about everything being the unity and the experience of being part of and in the middle of everything. "
"Reds, yellows, and oranges to begin with and very distinct hexagon shapes. 
Sinning vortex-like sensations, like a kaleidoscope with occasional bird-like shapes spinning around. 
Sometimes in the lower part of the picture very intense blues, greens and turquoise colours that occasional covered the whole picture. 
The blues, greens and turquoise shapes were softer shapes like bubbles and circles. "
"It was like bathing in the sun so bright that it sparked the creation of something new. The new beginning was red calls or shapes competing with the dark blue and eventually, everything would fuse together forming something that looked like a pool of water. Shimmering in the darkness which would level to the sunlight. 
It was very calming and peaceful creation. I felt safe and that only goodness could come from this. 
At one point I felt like I was travelling through the cells and shapes - part of the creation process. "
"From sunrise, yellow/ orange/red with very bright light, as the music change the colours also changed to more bright yellow and white with patterns like waves moving into spaces and getting more intense before moving into blue/ purple/ pink tones and turning circles. Between sets of colours everything turned black and white. There always seemed to be a central ‘goal’ that I couldn’t quite locate of fix with my eyes and from the edges a constant bright light but as soon as I shifted my gaze it would move or disappear. 
The overwhelming feeling was that there was something I was chasing but could never quite grasp, it was just out of my reach. However, it felt like I was safe in the chaos of colours and light. "
"Very relaxing reminded me of the meditation room we had at school sometimes when I was younger I didn't know there was reflection after so i wasn't really paying attention, just chilling out. The flashing lights made shapes and things kind of like what happens if you squeeze your eyes shut super tight or press your hands into your eyes after looking at the sun, which I guess was the point? I like the drawings other people did. One in front of me kind of reminds me of The Scream a bit and there is a very cool purple and black one so once again I wish I had more artistic abillity. I drew a rainbow thing because that’s my default when I don’t know what to draw. I liked seeing the inside of the church - I've driven past it 1000 times but never gone inside. "
"I saw mostly a hazy orange. With movement, sometimes the movement was like veins, sometimes like little rectangular bacteria dancing around a microscope. Sometimes a bit of the smoke puffing around, or little neurons sending signals dancing around. Sometimes there was a black background with a hazy green. Once I saw blue and red flash around with stars but mostly the orange. At the end it was purple. I didn’t feel much except with it would change it would make me laugh. Mostly I just felt very chilled. The music was great. "
"This was a great experience. I had very vivid shapes and colours and very frequent. At a stage I got a solid blanket dark purple that froze for a few secons, that was pretty cool! I seen a lot of shapes, mainly hexagons then later I seen circles. My forehead was vibrating which I thought was the seats but found out this was my own experience. 
I also seen a lot of sparkles throughout the experience. All very pretty scenes. 
The feeling after is calm and enlightening. 

Thanks so much to all the organisers for a fantastic show, I’m sure a lot of hours went into this. Many thanks! "
"At the beginning the journey started in a very gentle way. Everything was perfect to set our mind and body to relax. The music was perfect. The sweetness brought me in another world, thinking of joy, good memories, my family, and the need of peace and relax. The music increased in power, and the thoughts and experience were more powerful too. I had closed eyes, I opened them sometime to see the colours, but when I closed them again I could see the lights coming from the inside, especially the blue. 
Now that I am writing I have the eyes full of tears and I feel that I want to cry because all of my negative thought were throw away. I feel better, relaxed, free, in peace. "
"Right now I feel nervous inside right in the centre of my chest.
I think what just happened was that the music represented the night life.
Being born: beautiful music, a happy night followed. I take it that it was childhood.
Then we jog on - but oh then came this abrupt red noisy light and noisy music - I guess in life we have trials /traumas and so the trauma was there and then we passed that - but that noisy red music was still there - I can’t hear it. It was in the background - even when the music began happier - it never went back to childhood / the beautiful music at the start - that noisy red music was always "
"Seen all sorts of colours, shapes, movements transitioning while I assumed the level of light was varying. 
Thought very little altogether
Felt delighted the whole way through. Had to double check my eyes were closed as the colours were so vivid. Ryan H"
"The deep listening experience felt like I was elevated out of my seat, whereas the high sensory experience felt like I was sinking into my seat. I felt shivers all through my body in the deep listening and felt very relaxed throughout and afterwards. When the lights dim down , I see circles closing in on each other of different colours. It was mesmerizing, thank you for another wonderful experience! I would recommend both experiences to everyone."
"I seen Red Coats marching past  our offices on a white horse. I felt 1650 age wise.
As the sound got louder. I seen an enormous steam train surging past. I also seen a peasant man who had an arm blown off. At the star I was flying around the universe like a little fairy enjoying it. "
"I felt like I was moving through this tube-like pull in space and I had a split second thought visualization of me sitting flying through the wormhole -like- tube with many colours and a light at the end. I also have a few mental health conditions that cause dissociation and hallucinations, so I felt a common feeling I’ve had when dissociating, where I feel like I'm floating but rolling forwards without ever feeling upside-down. I felt very far away from my body especially my hands and feet. 
Though this was a nice safe environment, I was fine experiencing that feeling again."
"As if every cell in my body was being balanced and energized.
Feeling of intense happiness and joy. I had chakra cleaning intense weight on my chest.
Visions of moving through a desert with a whole line of people. Then sailing away with them in a huge sailing ship.
The feeling of exhilaration was intense as the music intensified and then the sweet calmness as it settled and gentle piano."
"Swirling specks which changed intensity almost like water ripples because of my astigmatism at times colours would come in and out of focus of there would be breaks of colours where my “eye floaters” usually would be
An endless void with some hints of colour"
"Incredible continuity of symmetrical, colours, shapes, sensorial feeling driven by the musical notes. The deep of conscience is conducted by energy in a colourful beauty experience. Fractals visions ended allowing acute colors"
"A thick texture dotted by the circle sounds of the gongs and the bells. 
A forest. 
Wading through the sea at Murlough Beach - the spray around my legs and ankles like jewels. 
I am huge, like a goddess of the sea and I can wade through the sea to the Isle of Man and with a sweep of my arm draw an enormous arc in the sky. 
Swimming and strong. Level and still.
But also swaying, slow dancing on the land with bare feet"
"I was shocked and jumped when Ann came back in and spoke. 
I am not sure I was asleep but I was definitely elsewhere. But I can’t describe the place or space I was at the time Ann spoke.
When I first felt myself drifting away, I was conscious of moving through a garden. Moving around and exploring through plants and organic matter. Almost as if I was a worm it seemed I came to water that I couldn’t cross. Then I was concentrating on the music. Following the music without being anywhere or conscious of anything."
"One of the memories is seeing a distant eye that starts to spin fast, but I could always see clearly the pupil. I was pretty nervous in the beginning. I really liked the setting of the room and the calm voice of the instructor. I saw bright colours from bright yellow to intense purple and strong blue and green. I saw sunlight over the desert, blue squares on the black background. I think I fell asleep when the eye was spinning, but when the performance was finished I felt really relaxed."
"Started off quite difficult to get my mind to relax and lost sense of time, time felt like breaths rather than minutes. Seen a lot of different colours at the start and then became people, spotted one of my grandad’s who is dead and has been for years which was odd because  hadn’t seen his face that clearly even in my own memory in years - experienced a lot of single like scenes with lions or what I thought were lions. "
"It was just fantastic to be able to see so many fractals and perfect symmetry. 
I speak spanish so this might be the wrong spelling.
I felt happiness when the yellow and white light took over all the space, it made me smile. So many beautiful colours!!!
I also felt that math are the most perfect “thing” in the world and that, because of that , God is math. 
What an amazing, once in a lifetime experience! Thank you so much!
:)"
"Great relaxation
Initially in the “taster” session, I felt like I was moving into another part of the universe, but my mind made me pull back and refocus as it felt too dangerous. 
Lots of colours - all different kinds.
Often complementary colours that I didn’t know / knew / couldn’t have told you before / went in. (maybe they’re not even complementary but just thought they looked great together - the pale pink and yellow-gold
Lots of nature - shapes started with colour in the centre and then spread out. 
Sometime irregular shapes (mostly)"
"A big orange Sun
I felt expansive like the space was endless, then plunged into darkness that was total.
At times I felt it was getting close to being overwhelming, but never went over the edge -l liked the different shapes to the flashes -some hexagonal -some stary -
The overall effect though is calming"
"It was really nice, it keeps me remembering all the stuff which I had planned to do/colplete but I forget to do and things which I am still planning to do next time with big life plans.
I saw different light colours and the airplane sound took my attention unless before that my was just analyzing different tasks to submit CV, personal statement… remembering family members, especially my last born sister and my dad and I saw myself being a well dressed nurse which is my life dream to be.
I feel I put myself somewhere alone and getting sleep into "
Dark space with patterns a bit like mist moving/clouds. No real colours but some dark blue shapes. At one point I felt brightness and warmth a bit like a sunrise. Relaxing but hard at times to push out intrusive thoughts re: “to do list”. At the end I felt very relaxed and reluctant to leave the space and experience. Felt a sense of a heart beating through the sound. At one point I also felt the sensation of a helicopter flying past. A positive relaxing experience.
"I found it hard to switch off my mind was thinking over things I need to do for work and also back on recent activities. Maybe as I was part of a group it was harder to focus on me as I was very aware of them and hoping they were ok. 
When the lights became brighter I began to feel warmth like facing the Sun. I began to feel like I was sitting on a beach listening to water clouds. 
However when the noise of what I felt was like a helicopter became slightly triggering I put my attention away from it. Made me feel something was wrong, like a helicopter which was flying over the city when trouble was happening. Also created a feeling that I was ready to come out."








"Initially it felt a little uncomfortable but after a while I relaxed and just let the images flow. The images changed and flowed with the music and the constant music was slightly disorientating but also relaxing. It felt peaceful and stimulating at the same time. 
The colours definitely changed with the music. A lot of the time it was just black and white, but a very intense black and white. "
"For the most part I experienced a beautiful kaleidoscope of colours and patterns. Sometimes sketchy trees or people, like shadows or ghosts appeared on the edges. Towards the end, it was like I started to travel forwards. A state of cosmos opened. It moved fast but then suddenly the image of an arm and shoulder in a purple quilted coat appeared. It was so familiar and yet not familiar at all, all at the same time. My mind scrabbled to know it, like it was lost, out of reach. I felt such sadness in that moment and a fear. A single tear for something, a memory or person that I could not hold onto. It was the most magical experience in that moment for the space of knowing what is important and what is not. "
"Feeling a great happiness and positive emotion, and very relaxed at the same time. Could have stayed there for much longer!! At the same time lots of green and blue visuals and moving dots etc. plus green too at points. Kind of like fractals but different. Felt like i was there for five minutes - no sense of time. I shed a few tears unexpectedly during the preview bit! Very positive uplifting experience, thank you. And the the same time very moving and emotional afterwards. "
"A lot of the time it was just colours and patterns but then sometimes I could see the sky moving across with clouds and big dark trees in the corner. But then there were patterned lights flying over. Later on I could see 2 figures, one male in appearance with short blonde hair like a playmobile character as the hair was plastic and stuck on. He was moving just diagonally but the would reappear in the right top hard corner and the same motion would happen. Then the figure reappeared with a larger figure with brown hair they came across a few times like a production line. Then some larger faces appeared that were like old plaster-cast statues but they disappeared. I also saw bald babies heads with halos like in teletubbies. But then they dissolved back into patterns. Sometimes i felt like i was falling into a pot of gold glitter. "
"At the start of each sequence it was like the beginning of a marvel movie flickering lights with sketched images underneath and uncompleted. This settled into a blue rippling effect like looking through a swimming pool. 
flicking/ twinkling like stars in a dark sky growing into geometric designs and mandalas. 
Occasional faces but not of people I know personally but rather idealised cultural forms like a person from India wrapped in colour. 
The silhouette of a great tree but missing the physical object and instead with a green misty presence. "
"At one point I felt like I was a pilot flying through a dust cloud but I was the one moving - spinning through the sky. I spent some time trying to manifest something in what I saw - I tried to see birds but it didn’t seem to be working so I gave up. Shortly after I gave up I saw a flock of birds appear behind. 
I felt on the edge between waking and sleep - conscious and unconscious. I’d love perception of everything around me. I can’t remember what I was seeing - then I’d come round. 
Quite a lot of quick changing patterns mixed with dust clouds. "
"Intense colours in organic and geometric shapes - these changes with the intensity of the light and/or the frequencies of the music. 
At times the light and the patterns felt almost too intense and I had to hold my nerve and know that it would be ok - and I was safe. 
It was a bit like experiences on LSD in the past but not entirely because there was no real world which was altered by the hallucogen - only what my brain/ internal world could make sense of. I kept truing to turn what I was seeing with something recognisable but I couldn't really. I did see organic shapes interlocking with what appeared to be my eyes in the intersections. I also saw what looked like the open jaw of a bat in the centre of my vision with the form of the bat suggested outside this. I saw so many things - at times the colour was na intense warm orange and it felt like sitting in a patch of sun with the sunlight intensifying then was very pleasurable and comforting. "
"A journey/ like a journey through space time - a drug free trip - a journey to visit the Bodhisattva, sitting in rows - space time travel through pastels, pallets of co-ordinated, curated, well chosen colour - how death might be - you never know! - a splash and a whizz into the dimensions of the universe, that we don’t acknowledge or see, or perceive, but may/ probably/ do? Exist all around us. Or the illusions of the mind :-) 
Too short!"
"It was much more relaxing than i thought it would be at the same time it was quite a lot of work. Towards the middle, i fell asleep i think. I kept waking up to  new and vivid scnes my little dreams are so vivid. I loved the way the light and music worked together. It was directing in every way. It was much to short!! More of the synth stuff at the end please. "
"At the beginning, i had to let go of control. I seen black and white for a while as i allowed myself to see beautiful patterns and colours. Vivid, birght orange was very comforting and filled my space. I then seen threads of red, quite angry. Lines of blue, green, purple, dark green kept coming up. I felt like i was a fish in the ocean, and being comforted by going deeper into the sea. I realised the comfort of this remind me of being in the womb. I seen the colourful flashing lines of my childhood, present day and my challenges, difficulties, happy and fun memories, i seen my old age, calm, sweet. In the darkness, i seen my fears and then this followed with my death. I was with God. at first, i felt quite scared because i didn’t know what to expect God was comforting, full of love, mercy, he loved me and was happy to see me. I seen this light, God, towards my left, and me then the back of me, and in a long, white dress, floating further awaye further and further into the distance. 
I cam back to my present day, just seen my whole lifee pass by me, but never, with more comfort. There’s nothing to be afraid of because it’s going to be ok. You’re loved and you’re strong. You shouldn’t  be afraid to live. "
"I definitely found it easy to ‘zone out’ more when the lighting and flashes and vibrations were more intense, I think that it was meant to be relaxing during the more mellow partys but i personally found it hard to let go during these parts. Towards the end I did start to relax and I think I was even on the verge of falling asleep which is when I started seeing more physical forms rather than just patterns. "
"It was hard to disconnect from my thoughts in the beginning. At some point, I realised I should pay more attention to what I was seeing. When I did so, I felt la little bit overwhelmed by the speed and intensity of the lights. I put the mask on and I relaxed a bit. I then took the mask off and was more able to see the lights. Sometimes a beautiful warm yellow light was appearing. It felt like someone was hugging me. The strobe lights were intense but the colours were joyful so it was a bit stressful (my heartbeat was very fast) but not scary. Although maybe a bit scary but no bad intentions, not mean in any way. I guess it is related to the notion of control and overproduction of thoughts. To summarise, i felt stressed, hugged, relieved, calm and panicked. I had the feeling the experience was neither short or long, a bit out of time. "
"The clean white light felt like a dawn on a summers day, very warm and uplifting feeling. The pulsating lights created a number of geometric patterns, initially hexagons and then more predominantly chevrons. Once I got used to it I began playing and exerting some control of the forms by changing the shape of my eyelids and moving my eyes. By “focussing” on part of the pattern I could produce a fractal effect. 
After a while, my brain was like “ok so this is the new normal” and started wandering off into new thoughts. Most bizarrely I started thinking about U2?! "
"When the first bright light began, i felt like i had to look away - the light was too strong. This feeling dissipated and i was ok to begin enjoying the blue and red colours appearing around the outer edges of my vision. These colours began to pulsate and rotate. This quickly disappeared, however, when the light dimmed. When the light dimmed i was left with a central blue orb-like shape which gew larger when the light started to strobe again, my view changed to a pattern. "
"Whenever the lights went out, i saw lots of blue circles over and over until all I saw was a field of infinitely many, infinitely small blue circles. In the dark, i felt like the darkness was moving away from me. I tried to keep track of the colours i had seen and each time when i thought of one i hadn’t seen i saw it shortly after - was i directing my brain to see it? I wonder if i could have seen any colours i’d never seen before? There was often a ‘centre’ or middle and when i moved my eyes the centre around which all the other shapes orbited, would also move. I often forgot my eyes were closed and was surprised to remember they weren’t open. I felt like i saw most of the shapes with my right eye. "
"I was both underneath and high above everything. I was travelling down a long open road looking up at the sky and then I was falling through the clouds and huge patterns, towards the sea reflecting the bright sunlight. The sounds shaped the patterns as if the light was water being distributed by hand or orange objects. 
I was on a boat watching waves of light broadcast away from me and take me further out. Visions exploded from the centre with tiny supernovas which sometimes were faces of people I know. I saw mostly yellow and orange, until a green leaf exploded leaving red cracks and blue fireworks. White whips like laser beams. 
Finally everything made way to a blue world, and it was the brightest, fullest blue I had seen so far, as if I had been pulled underwater. "
"Be here now 
The future is unpredictable and uncontrollable - let it go. 
If everything (EVERYTHING) fell apart, you would be ok because you would have you. 
My mother is always with me
True peace and happiness is a warm feeling and completely obtainable
I can radiate and spread whatever energy I hold within myself 
I can release everything that holds me back from being my highest version of myself 
I am exactly where I need to be right now 
I can make it through uncomfortableness "
"During the test experience i felt surprisingly anxious and out of control. I saw a blue and red grid image flashing hard causing my eyes to twitch. I quickly realised this lack of control flet unsafe so reverted to my go-to coping mechanism: dissociation. What i loved about it in this instance was how i seemed to be able to do it at will, choosing when to “hard focus” and pulling back to focus more on textures when i needed to recalibrate. I wish i’d had a little longer to explore. There was a short period where i was sure i could see my own nose, i even tilted my head down to see if i could see my own body even though my eyes were closed. I saw a blown-up version of my own reflection, never in full, just small parts - an eye, a mouth, never whole. I felt sad at this, seeing my own xxx before my eyes. I saw beady eyed birds eyeing me up with a single pupil. I saw an eagle smile at me. I saw jellyfish clouds. I mourned my own mind while being grateful for it for keeping me safe. "
"
I found I could not imagine real world objects or scenes the way I normally could (eg a mountain) but when I focused on the shapes and colours in front me I could impose reality upon them much in the same way we make faces and objects from clouds in the sky. At moments when the intense strobing subsided and (I presume) the large back light was on I saw intense orange colour fall of little biological shapes like sleepers we get normally. When the intense strobing was on generally it had a focus point where it would move it to. "
"Very different to the last time I took part in Dreamachine. 1st time was lots of binary shapes and only two colours. On this occasion i was witnessing much more significant bursts of colour and shapes. I found it difficult to keep up with the visualisation that was going on. It was constantly changing and flicking from on thing to the next. Very much like a kaleidoscope. So strange to experience something so different this time. I came @ same time of day the last time and was really tired going into the Dreamachine. This time I was even more tired and was experiencing so many visuals. I've left the space extremely relaxed, not tired just relaxed. Time was lost during my experience. "
"Patterns of blue and red. Sometimes like when passing through a tunnel at speed. When the lights changed I’d see green and blues in a Voronoi like pattern - very calm. I drifted off for a while. I don’t know if was asleep or in a deep state but I was less aware of the lights and sounds. I thought of some people, like my parents, but nothing in particular. I came back to the room (still eyes shut) when there were some loud noises and lights - it felt aggressive and sounded like a war zone with helicopters flying around. It was black and purple and was like I could see the strobe of the helicopter blades. I’d hoped it wasn’t the end as I’d missed a lot of it I think. The last bit was quite relaxing though, but I felt deeply relaxed. "
"The bright white steady light = mmmm :-) like sun in a field, like Kings Cross station with Harry and Dumbledore. Like peace, like rest, like everything - just rightness. The flashing lights = currents, how can things move like that? Layers, movement in different directions, swirling. Very often, a pink and green flashing square/ diamonds always wherever my focus was, intensifying when I focused on it. Lattice squares interlocking.  
Yellow and black swirls, like a lava lamp (I heard someone else who’s been here describe it like this). swirling . how long did it last? At some point I stopped LOOKING still could see but I was less focused on what was in front of my eyes, felt so relaxed, didn’t want it to end, thought I saw a persons# face, aware of the part of me searching for meaning wanting more, wanting to see a scene with people, like a cartoon or a movie playing in my mind. Wanting to relax, let go, not push. Rest rest rest rest rest. REST. I need rest. "
"I found some of the light very overwhelming alternating red and green, red and blue patterns coming towards me were making me a little anxious. I stayed with myself. There were solid fields of purple and green which made me feel very peaceful. I felt my mind go away - I was drifting. I was not aware of my body. I could feel at times great peace. I could feel the divine like god. There were feelings of utter peace. I was present, but, away. Now I am feeling very “full” I feel kind of sad. I had a few tears. But it's a peaceful sadness. I really feel like I had an experience. I feel very quiet in myself, something has been stirred and it needs to settle. "
"Felt like I was on a journey through the universe. There were waterfalls made of golden stars. I fell down the waterfall and came into a tunnel of brilliant, brilliant blue light. Travelled past different planets - some gentle and welcoming, some not so much. At the same time, I was travelling further back into my childhood. Finally I was in my mothers womb. I could feel her heart beating and her swallowing and moving. I was suspended, my arms floating in front of me like 2 stumps. I saw myself as a vulnerable soul, with so much to go through. I felt compassion and love for myself. I cried a bit. I wish it could have lasted longer. It was a great experience. Thank you!! xxx"
"Difficult to get comfortable, couldn’t “rest” my arms. no r follow the breathing exercise. And during the ‘taster session’ i felt a bit panicky that it was going to be too intense. Then the actual session started and it was much less intense. Colours were less vivid more black and whites. It felt manic in my head as if I was travelling both backwards and forwards really fast but at the same time my physical body was getting more and more relaxed. Then it would go dark and the music slowed and I thought oh no its ending :-( but then a ‘galaxy’ or little green lights appeared in darkness. So many kaleidoscopes of patterns and then ‘daylight’ as if the sun had come out and was shining on my face and I felt like I was smiling inside. Maybe smiling too. over all the most relaxing experience in an uncomfortable position!!
LOVE IT. would definitely want to experience it again. Thank you for the opportunity of this experience. "
"Deeply relaxing, all over, mind and body. It was in part like being shot into some abstract galaxy, in part like falling through a kaleidoscope. Loads of red and green, minute pictures of things I couldn't make out backgrounding the patterns. It ended too soon but anything would have been too soon I’d love to do to sleep in there (and actually may have done so for a moment). Hopefully I’ll dream about it tonight and go falling through a kaleidoscope and more. Loved this. Thanks, Jason  "
"Taster - more intense… amazing colours and shapes. Textures varied. Sensation of floating in the galaxy. Each scene had an nucleus or an eye. Eyes played a big part - moving and finding other scene were leading me to another concept/ place. Overall peaceful and tranquil… on  few occasions depending on the noise felt a little nervous… but this passed! 
Feel this could induce peaceful sleep and deep relaxation. It would be interesting to introduce vibration alongside the noise and varying white light. 
Each scene ended in patterns of people grey and black which indicated the end of that scene, providing a clearance for a new scene. "
"To start I was focused on colours and patterns mostly seeing both patches of a single colour - orange, purple. And when the light flashed, patterns very like a kaleidoscope, symmetrical. Then at point when I was seeing red and bright white patterns, bursting outwards, I started telling myself stories about the apocalypse, associating with fire, explosions, not surprising considering the current news about war and climate emergency. The music didn’t really seem to make such of a difference - I am a lover of music and the background type as here doesn’t really mean much to me. "
"
I felt very very relaxed about half way through - I felt a fairly sudden and big release of tension in my neck and shoulders. The relaxation lingered afterwards. For the most part, I didn’t think about anything - although oddly for a few minutes I blanked out, stopped noticing the visuals and started thinking about eating chicken and fish. I am a vegetarian but have been worried lately about energy levels and protein levels etc. I thought about this and a wave of guiltlessness about eating some meat. I currently would feel guilty eating meat but I had this experience of animals and us being all equal and unaccountable for needs and none should feel guilt. If a vulture eats another animals kills, why should I feel guilty about eating meat in the supermarket if I didn’t hunt for it. I am not better than the vulture."
"Took me to dream-like scenes reflecting beautiful moments from my childhood but linked to something very current in my life. 
Also some more disturbing upsetting fears came to the fore around my partners health right now but still a moving experience that reminded me of the beautiful things and people I have in my life right now and the need to be present and enjoy what I have. Thank you. So powerful and moving. "
"It was totally mesmerizing. I saw a lot of coloured lines (mostly red and blue) which moved to cross over each other into a sort of grid that glowed green from behind. It changed at times to a glowing gold with large black pillars growing from nothingness and disappearing. 
My thoughts mostly disappeared and then came back and intensely focussed on one of two every now and again. 
It was an intense but strangely relaxing experience. "
"From the initial dark and music being introduced, everything begins with the sensation of falling asleep in the sun. 
This was typically followed by a blackout and then an intense blue/ purple colour immersed you. This was then broken by the strobe light and patterns and geometry playing and constantly moving. 
Intermittently this was puncttured by an intense almost painfull white out. 
Very difficult to believe your eyes were closed at times. 
The focal point kept returning to a blue calm sky, then the cycle would begin again. "
"I saw a lot of pue orange light which felt like being bathed in  warm sunshine. This was interspersed with flashing images almost like a flower head in the middle. 
I did not find it easy to let myself go in the experience - might be easier next time round. Heard helicopter sounds towards the end before all went calm. "
"At the beginning, I really enjoyed the still light and it felt like I was sunbathing and there were other times of a similar stillness that felt like I was lying beneath a sunset in a field of on the beach. 
There was a moment when the lights were more flickering that felt like I was standing in a rainstorm and looking up at the sky, watching the raindrops come down head on. 
A lot of the time I was just looking at an array of colours moving in different patterns; swirls, grids, spots, waves. 
When the experience ended there was a large portion of the experience where I’m not sure if I was awake or asleep. I was aware my breath was heavier as though I was asleep but I was very conscious of how my breath was moving in ebbs and flows. It was during this portion that I saw a lot more images (flowers, people, hands) that felt like I was dreaming - not sure if I was or not! "
"I felt relaxed and connected to my body. I felt the deeper base sounds tingling on my face, lips and chin. My mental chatter came through at times and at other times I was full “in” the experience. My eyes opened a few times to enjoy the soft lights. I closed them mostly. As the music ramped up I saw a flash of a psychedelic type mirage of a blue portal with two black gates. I enjoyed the purple visionary colours that dominated. My main thought was about I loved music and sound therapy and I am excited to finish my course now and blend the healing sound instruments with computer music and speakers/ furniture for the optimum/ expansive experience for relaxation and wellbeing. Thank you. "
"Initially, a series of grey/taupe 3-d like hexagonal/ octagonal shapes with only a tiny concentration of red colour in a sort of A shape in the centre of the image. This seemed to be default which repeated, tho with gradual incursion of the red/ yellow brighter colours from centre, as each episode of this image repeated during session. 
A bright clementine-orange colour in shapes - another repeat pattern. 
Also, a deep blue with ultraviolet ‘sparkle dots’ swimming in the centre of image, a bit like a galaxy - occasional, repeat. 
Once of twice a complete ERASURE of symbol or colour - not a white space but a clear grey with slight horizontal striations across. FEELING slight panic, as thought this was embodiment of empty space or no reaction/ end of neuropathway - no response. In my brain. NOTE! I’ve attained this ONCE before in a c.45 minute ‘om’ chant meditation. 
Occasional glimpse of purple circle as concentration point of image, against a variety of other changing ‘backgrounds’ of images. Hope this was my third eye chakra!"
"I was surrounded by a world moving very fast. It felt like the opposite of freefalling - my environment was ‘falling over and past me’ maybe
Lots of colours I haven’t seen awake and with eyes closed. Unfamiliar blues and pinks. And a very intense brilliant red. 
I am an actor by profession and this experience felt, in a strange way, like what i do for a living. Emptying the mind in order for it to be filled by stimuli that will emotionally manipulate me. "
"This time was completely different. I came in with an open mind but I suppose also with expectations. 
Last time I felt an overwhelming sense of joy and peace. This time I felt semi distracted and my mind wandered off quite a few times. When I felt my mind wander, I almost forgot that the experience was happening. I had to continue to bring my mind back to the experience and tell myself not to waste this. 
I saw more purples, greens and yellows, whereas last time I saw lots of reds and bright orange and yellows. 
The feeling was so completely different this time. The sense of distraction seemed to overwhelm the experience for me. It was no less interesting, just different and perhaps less enjoyable in some ways. "
"This was a profoundly spiritual experience (tops) 
I felt like I was travelling through space, time, other worlds, and the centre of the earth simultaneously. I was infinite. 
Connected to the collective consciousness and all spirits, my ancestors, my soul family and the higher power - whatever that is. Cosmos, God, mother nature. I had a sense of our connectedness. 
Towards the end I had separated my past as other and felt it could be opened without being hooked by it. This was very emotional. 
The message, the belief: everything is going to be fine. "
"Mostly white and graduation of white light. Some flashes of purple, red green. no yellow or blue is discernable but blends of them in the green and purple. Also quite a nice coral with tiny green spots. 
Interesting snow-globe effect with actual snow melting. Saw what could be either canals, the brain or small intestine. Heard a helicopter - a bit unsettling as I thought of napalm and agent orange then saw images and photos from Vietnam which is interesting as a helicopter usually means someone is getting arrested where I am from. "
Very geometrical shapes in lots of movement coming towards me - away from me - always a feeling of movement. Colours of vivid orange/ luminous pink and fluorescent green shapes. On my periphery were white/ grey stones or statues. Almost moon surface shaped. Very 3d. Some images rushed at me in a way that I felt my heart jump and beat faster. Towards the end I went through a mass of green bubbles/ grass that I travelled through. Then ended up very much swimming through blue/ultra violet bubbles. These bubbles were all floating towards a whirlpool I could see in the distance. These were often ‘stretch marks’ in white across the whole images. Sparkling like linear stars. I didn’t want to leave. X 
"Mainly a kaleidoscope of geometric shapes and colours started with triangles and very symmetrical but would change to more rounded images. Saw lots of different colours but when the light went off it was predominantly black with purple. Actually felt overwhelmed, bordering on feeling on edge. Scared until I got used to the experience. Then I was able to relax and enjoy it more. I focused more on the visual element than the music. Feel a little unsettled now like I might get a sore head. "
"What it made me realise was how tense and stressed I was -I couldn't just relax into the moment - too many thoughts/ worries kept intervening. 
However, I think I was very much influenced by the space I was in. ie, the church - shapes from it were uppermost in my mind - eg. grottos. Nevertheless i did find it incredibly relaxing - I wasn’t aware of others around me - just of how aching my back was and how tight my jaw was. All in all it was a wonderful experience. Relaxing. "
"First reaction was like sun on my face. More lights come in, I tried to not let my face have a big smile (make me feel awkward) but there it was, it made me happy. My face was relaxed and I was smiling whether I wanted it or not. I try to control my thinking into not thinking about “what to see” but more enjoying the experiment. It was uncomfortable for a tiny bit and I tried to resist it, but then it all went spinning, very much like being drunk for the first time… 
I had images of memories, feeling like a kaleidoscope, being a bee and visiting the flowers. I even had a floating vision reminding me of the move life of Pi. and felt like doing that rollercoasters in the dark I did ages ago. I was, as predicted, very influenced by the sound (like being underwater) and plane noise made me think of a bomber towards the end. But the whole experience was amazing. Thanks you. "
"See: colour but overwhelmingly red, with blue being the second dominant colour. I saw shapes and cascading flowers in my peripheral vision - mostly daisies. I saw green and purple flowers which were also shaped like diamonds. I saw an eye staring back at me. 
Think: I thought it was powerful, it was unusual and often overwhelming. I maybe overthought in my determination to see or feel something profound. I had lots of mundane and random thoughts. I think a second time would be really beneficial. 
Feel: I felt nervous, I felt calm, I felt underwhelmed, I felt overwhelmed, I felt expectation, I felt relaxed, I felt curious, I felt intrigued, I felt warm, I felt uncomfortable, I felt that I was glad to have taken part and experienced it. Thank you. "
"Lots of red throughout the experience. It was very intense and more relaxing when it switched to other colours. I could see lots of shapes, almost like tile prints - baroque mostly bathroom tiles. I kept feeling and seeing the sun at points which was nice and I felt warmer when I did. There was also a feeling of being elevated towards the sky - like being on a plane and going through clouds which was nice. I didn’t see any images, only the feeling of going towards something the shapes I noticed resembled colourful gassy looking shapes - like in the universe. Things seems to slow down a bit here as sometimes the pace was really quick. When it was halfway through it almost felt like I was experiencing elements of the weather - particularly lightening strikes and a blue flag. I didn’t/ couldn’t put a word on how to describe some shapes - almost like a beehive - honeycomb. My favourite colours were like pink. "
"At first warmth, sunshine. A peaceful grove of sunlit trees and floating bees. An orange path of silk ribbon stretches out towards a far off white light on the corner of my vision. 
The white light grew bigger, engulfing all I saw and at first was scared. Then the white light took shape and I flew above a kaleidoscope of white marble structure which rose and fell beneath me as I floated. They had the feeling of great cathedrals, empty and desolate but comforting. Their walls were patterned with crosses and squares which shifted as a tried to focus on them. Towers of light. 
The space below me became the world, rippling with threads of colour; of green and blue and sapphire. My heart felt wide as though the whole earth lay below me and I could somehow absorb it all. I saw my reflection on the peak of every wave, in every bend. I got that giddy feeling of wanting to laugh with adrenaline. 
Suddenly a lake of darkness. No light. A chasm that felt at once echoing and small. Then the sound of starlight, soft bells in every available space but never touching each other. And then I was swimming in the darkness and it was blue bioluminescence and it covered my hands and made them flow. It broke over me in waves, lighting everything in its path. "
"At the start it was like going through dust and then a cloudly nebula. At times the light was so bright I felt I had to close my eyes like in the sun and I felt warm. At times I saw lots of flashing red in different shapes and movements - spiralling coming towards me moving away moving past me. At times I felt like sitting dreamily on a train with clouds/ sky whizzing by. Lots of colour - browns, greys, blues - but predominantly red and yellow. 
Not sure if the lights were flashing in time to the music or whether the music was shaping the images but that is what is felt like. I saw an eye at one point. When the music went quiet near the end if was grey blue with what looked like tendrils of plants reeling up and in the middle was a slowly growing light that expanded out and the tendrils were growing towards the light and the light grew and grew. "
"Felt like I was being born and discovering all my senses for the first time. In deep relaxation. Sunrise and sunset. Travelling through the multiverse as a light being. Discovering and feeling different laws of physics. Becoming solid and liquid and gas sometimes simultaneously. Deep emotional connection to the light, sound, pattern and speed/ tempo. Saw a face and a figure of spinning light. At the end I was brought with a memory but felt like it was a new real experience. It was with someone who was and stil is very special to me. We often talked about what happens after death and philosophical on life from I was a young age. When I saw him I was overwhelmed with love and calm. I could smell him and feel his presence but didn't see every detail of his face. But felt so strongly that he was there. I was not expecting this. My body was very heavy and I became very emotional. When I moved into the reflection area, I felt like I was leaving something I didn’t want to leave but knew would and is always there. I have vivid dreams and have had similar experiences during sleep. This was much more intense. I am not an emotional person but have been emotional in a similar way during transcendental meditation/ retreat. 
I feel grateful, drained, emotional, content, and inspired as I am writing this. As an artist, the colours were so beautiful and diverse. I remember seeing similar as a child, I used to close my eyes and let the light take me on a journey. 
Everyone should get to experience the Dreamachine at least once. If they are able. Thank you.  "
"It was intense and I’m lost for words. It felt like dreaming in a conscious state so everything I thought about became more disconnected and it’s brighter then when you are actually dreaming. I kept coming back into my body and almost jolting myself into reality. It was relaxing and like an extra layer on to meditation. Usually when you meditate it's a very in-body experience and you can lose yourself in the quiet but the lights in the dreamachine are loud and in your face. They make you stay with the visuals and focus on the back of your eyelids. The patterns flash and repeat and when the lights dim you feel yourself fall and when they are really really bright you feel the lights lift you up. Everything in your chest feels light and full of air, like you’re flying. I think I fell asleep a few times like I lost the lights and had to find myself again. When you come back, the light holds your focus and the pattern can overwhelm your eyes. My eyes tried to follow the flashing but I found it difficult like my eyes kept getting tired - lights, sound and meditation mixed together can take you somewhere where their singular parts are unable to. You come out feeling relaxed and like you’ve just woken from a nap, warm. The staff were really welcoming and friendly too. Rachel took our group and did a real good job taking us down to start and finish. The church is also beautiful space to hold something like this in. overall 10/10 would do again. "
"Deep relaxation. Multiple colours, shapes and designs. Some designs and shapes repeated once or twice but many quite different. Most vibrant colour was green and was in the centre of the focus. Time passed very quickly. Felt like I was in the room for only 5 minutes yet at the same time when finished had a post nap feel. At times quite tunnel like and dream state and others felt like sitting still. And designs and shapes coming towards eyeline. Appeared just differently everytime. Sometimes from edges, top and centre. Felt almost reflective at times. Music was part of the experience but felt like light was the most relaxing despite being intense with lots of changing colours and shapes. "
"With the constant change in the light, I saw and experienced an awakening of my soul. Each colour affected what I saw and experienced throughout. With bright colours, especially with warm while I experienced happiness and felt satisfaction of achieving something though I haven’t seen anything clearly in particular, I felt myself running through a field which had mostly yellow and orange flowers with backlighted by sunlight. The music made me feel the celebration of my achievements (not to lean on what I have achieved), the background bass of the music especially made me to dance. Overall, I enjoyed and experienced the whole dreaming like a celebration. "
"At first I was very unsure. Do I keep my eyes open, do I close them. Once I decided to keep them closed I experienced two events. My San Francisco trip and my granny who sadly passed away this year. She took me to watch Glentoran football every Saturday as a child. When I was in San Francisco I was thinking about Christina. All the regret, shame and guilt. She means so much to me and I started to think about her in an intimate way. I want kids with her and for us to be parents. I have for a while neglected her and now I have realised how much I appreciate her, her body, her mind, her as a woman etc. San Francisco was a happy place and to go there in my mind helped me. "
The music became very visual as I listened. The visuals developed into shapes and colours in my mind before sparking memories that felt really visceral as I lay there. These memories were safe and gentle in how they appeared and I felt incredibly calm as I watch them unfold in my minds eye. I also thought about my people. As the music built to quite a loud crescendo it brought to my mind my children. Again this felt calm and safe and gentle but all the same surprising to me that it was at that part they came to mind. I found the whole experience very calming and a different but equally welcome approach to meditation. The music helped keep my focus on the present and while thoughts still came and went it was only to let them pass without judgement. Would feel inspired to use music more often in meditation now. 
"The breathing set the tone for a meditative beginning into the journey through a kaleidoscope of celestial colour. A transformative journey through colour and space. A sense of floating through the most vibrant saturated colour fields interspersed with soft, soothing dark areas of rich colours of the deepest peach colours. The shapes varies from geometric optical shapes through to the softest pulsating spheres of radiant energy. The music enhanced the transformative experience, feeling elevated, a sense of a higher emotional experience. A walk through to another dimension of time and space - almost out of body experience - I wish I had photographic stills of some of the colour combinations I saw. Electric turquoise, yellows, warm magenta, uplifting peaches, the darkest hues of turquoise. Northern lights on blast bombard. Emphasised by light and colour. Completely immersive. "
"At first I was overwhelmed than I relaxed the bright light was intense - I kept trying to make sense of the patterns or find sometime to focus on. 
I accepted that I could not focus and found it very abstract - once I accepted this I relaxed and enjoyed the light show. 
I felt like I was moving through it and was aware of aches and pains in my body. I did have a peep when the lights were low. I experienced bursts of colour and change in patterns with the music. I can remember most blue as the lights were less intense in the darkness. I feel a lot sad that i cannot properly remember everything I saw but enjoyed the experience. "
"I felt like I was in a dream, floating through space and time. I saw lots of reds, oranges, yellows and blue night sky with white stars. Near the beginning of the experience I went through a spinning circular tunnel of red circles and blue waves. I saw a lot of waves of red light and an intense moment when I saw lots of oval shapes of yellow light surrounded by bright orange light and that was surrounded by right red lights. Near the end of the experience I saw something that resembled a static tv screen. "
"The experience was simultaneously visceral, emotional and intellectually expansive. At times this was liberating and almost felt like being given adrenaline but at others it became quite intense and frightening. The experience of coming into the church in the middle of a sectarian and run down part of Belfast that I had never been to before on a wet blustery Saturday afternoon was one of the most positive parts of the experience. It’s wonderful to see the sunflowers, the …. And young people come into the heart of Belfast - a truly mind opening experience not just for me but for Belfast. Thank you. "
"Bright checkerboards like flying heraldry VCR tape green-red blue-yellow light flowering and budding black orbs, speeding forward then diagonally. Darkness then bright down, gentle, obliterating, then the shapes again. Lost track of time. No body, no shapes, no signs or forms, just colour and movement. A glimpse of speeding trees. At the end an eye, like Balor. It opens and burns away the rest, it closes on darkness. But slowly a yellow sky returns. "
"My experience started with a warm orange glow - I thought of sunrise in the morning, hitting my eyes through closed eyelids. Saw grid-like graphic patterns - shapes, lines and chequerboard patterns in pink, red, orange and green colours. I felt calm and relaxed throughout; my mind wandered and I thought about many things. It wasn’t at all what I was expecting - I imagined I would see organic shapes and it was surprising how much of what I saw was straight lines and patterns! I do a lot of yoga and am used to breath exercises - this kept me feeling grounded and at ease throughout. Really interesting experience. Thanks! "
"Beautiful spirals of colour which blended to create a vortex that continued to guide me through twists and turns. These were permeated by blurts of star-like space which appeared to have words on them that I couldn’t quite make out. Occasionally I could see human-like figures, followed by images of the earth spinning. I then went through memories of my wide, my brother when we were younger. I was flooded with memories we had together growing up, from silly arguments to laughs and giggles. This has been at the forefront of my mind recently so I was happy I had time to process all that has went on. "
"Many things that made me feel like I lived in a Bridget Riley painting. Mostly I felt like I was barrelling at sped down a tube (like in a water park) towards a small scene in the end. Sometimes I could see I was travelling towards the sea. The walls of the tube are changeable, mostly it was made up of round balls like a ball pit. In the background (behind the balls) there were white letters. 
Overall there were brief moments where it felt like too much but mostly it was relaxing, and I continue to feel relaxed now. 
There was a point during the taster where I felt like I was watching the night sky. Predominant colours were blue/ teal/ white/ purple with flashes of red. "
"That time passed incredibly quickly - I'm not sure how long it lasted ‘really’ but it only felt like 15 minutes or so. I felt like it could have gone on for much longer. One of the most appealing things that happened was when the strobing stopped, and I saw massive parachutes of infinitely granular space - almost like I could see particles and atoms 0 when I was very little I used to have waking night terrors (probably little panic attacks), and everything I touched and heard has this terrifying granularity to it. This time I experienced the same textural effect, but I was unconcerned - not frightened - and felt a detachment that allowed me to just observed it in all its beautiful detail. "
"Felt at peace, that everything would be ok. Felt relaxed, and no pain or tension in my body. Everything external melted away felt like I had a great rest and ‘woke up’ feeling refreshed. 
Saw lots of geometric shapes in mostly blue, but also red, purple and yellow. Some were distinct shapes, like grids of dots and hexagons, others overlaid each other like circles, like looking through a kaleidoscope as a child. "
"Geometric square (red background, blue lines) grids with chamfered edges. 
Explosions of tiny stars fading out with a dark abyss in the centre (white light/ dark against bright)
Wide hexicons with yellow and orange sky and a bright sun above - arid, flat, desert with a hint of city below the horizon (large, neolithic, paved concrete)
Shattered geometrics, broken fragments - when the sounds faded more muted colours/ greys/ taupe/ mauve
Some spirals but subtle - swirls of green and blue against dark backgrounds
Windows mouse cursor arrow - the only anthropological shape!! What does this say about me?! 
Coral reef of small, tubular tentacles with green and blue and white heads. "
"At first during the taster session I felt a little apprehensive but then I began to see repetitive layers of patterns that were spinning and flickering. 
I am not sure how much I could reflect what I saw either visually or verbally. It was a very unique experience with moments of calm, elation and periods of intense visual imagery. The colours were the kind of colours that are so aesthetically pleasing but that are not often experienced in reality. They conveyed more of an out-of-body experience or some kind of trip. I feel very calm following the experience, almost meditative and thoughtful or almost a bit like I have no thoughts, my brain is not focused. I kept trying to follow and control the images similar to how you would in a dream but at times there was just so much happening that it was almost impossible. There was layers of bright coloured pattern with layers of what looked like pencil sketches or diagrams in the background. There was quite often a central part - circular - with different lights radiating at and from that central point. "
"I felt quite calm and the experience to be quite reflective. The start made me think like it was light at the end of the tunnel. I think observed my life from a third person perspective - childhood to growing up. There were many happy memories - such as birthday parties, family events, seeing friends, meeting Kay - lots of nice things we have done together. At times it also switched to me being at a rave and enjoying the music completely in the present moment. I also had future-facing thoughts like I was old looking back a things in like that I let bother me that I shouldn’t have. It was quite calming and meditative in this way. When the music went slow - it brought me back to reality a bit. Overall the whole thing felt euphoric and a journey. At the beginning i felt expectant and a little nervous. Initially I found the strong bight light a little uncomfortable but soon adapted. I felt curious and interested by the different patterns. 

At times I felt a sense of reflectiveness and perspective - some of the patterns made me thing of the vastness of space and how small we are related to it. Sometimes I felt sad - the fast-paced movement made me reflect on pressures and constant change. 
At times my mind wandered and I thought of my own preoccupations. Other times I felt happiness that our minds have the capacity to create such patterns and that people had the inspiration to create this. "
"I saw a field of stars, which came in and out of view throughout almost the entire experience. It was as if I was travelling through a starfield, rapidly changing direction. Much of it was similar to TV and film representations of warp tunnels or wormholes - as in 2001: A Space Odyssey. 
During the final phases of the experience that was a more natural set of images appearing as in trees, flower patterns, but not for long. 
Much of the focus was on spirals of squares, changing colours, stars. 
At one point I felt/ saw people enter into my vision. This coincided with the rhythm of the music - like - footsteps. 
The introductory experience was blue, i felt most ‘dream-like’ - the main experience for some reason was not as immersive. In fact, I found myself overthinking a lot - analysing the experience in an almost anxious way. This was not present in the first taster. 

I have taken a variety of hallucinogens - LSD, mushrooms and the experience was very similar to dreams on drugs - including ecstasy. Not the experience itself but the dreams afterwards. 

I found that focusing on my breathing helped me to get back into the experience when I was pulled out of it - just as in meditative practise. "
"When red predominated did not enjoy but enjoyed the lilac, purple green and navy spirals and curved shapes. I found it mainly relaxing but the red seemed to unsettle. 
The music and breathing were enjoyable and many of the shapes swirling were calming, spoiled by the red for me. "
"At first it felt like the whole room was spinning, it took a while until I grounded myself by taking a few deep breaths. The first image I could see was the outline of a baby in the yellow/ red light. Almost like I was looking at a womb. I felt very emotional as I almost had a connection to it. Then I was launched into flashing blue, white atmosphere. It reminded me of murder and lightning, then city lights. I later found myself in a brighter light which felt like mountains and snow. Constantly facing the different seasons and feeling exposed to nature. It felt like a safe space, it made me think of how the earth is burning and how nature has responded to us destroying it. Then after more purple, green, pink flashing lights I could see clumps of people and at every centre there was green. To me, this represents our heart and soul. The good nature that many of us hold but some was tainted with darkness. It was almost like looking through people and seeing for who they are. For me it all ended by looking at an open horizon, it was peaceful, there were mountains and still water that went on for miles. I am not sure where it was but it was probably one of the most beautiful and breathtaking places I had ever been. "
"I could see recurring spinning set of dots in the middle and expanding out. Bright neon colours appeared a few times in a sequence in circles and in squares equally spaced out. At times when the lights and music calmed, I could see a light orange colour getting lighter and lighter which was moving like static. I could see a dark blue colour with geometric shapes moving around. 
When the music intensified, the colours and shapes were moving faster, spinning, shapes changing from different geometric designs. When the music changes to a whirring helicopter sound, I would see the propellers moving - it looked like and felt like I was being lifted into the sky. At the end the colours got lighter as the music calmed and I was being lifted higher. The colours were solid blue/ white/ yellow - changing between the three. "
"I felt like the beginning of Casty Away, appearing on a beach totally deserted, and the sound of the waves waking me up. I started to wonder how people this is lost in a storm on sea can survive and be transported to an island. 
I saw a totally white sand beach and a very clear water. I felt like the sun was bright but not very hot. It was just like a slightly warm breeze, like the ones you could enjoy on a summer night in where I am from - Spain. 
I felt calm and relaxed. I felt I was almost falling asleep and like in a trance but then the helicopter sounds pulled me out. I didn't like that sound. It made me feel anxious. Luckily, the helicopter sound went away and a very relaxed music at the very end made me recover a very relaxed stated. I will definitely do it again. "
"Wonderful - too short; feel totally relaxed now and in a good mood. I only saw colourful lights, shapes, waves and I felt centred in my chest, my body being all light, nearly floating at some stage. I felt I had a focus point in front of me, like a dark spot the movements came out from, or went towards. Sometimes I could dissolve this focus spot and make it explode then i felt extra good, like I was pushing my boundaries. 
There was a little while were i felt i was my whole world - that there was nothing there beyond my experience. And i had a quick thought if I could connect with parents somehow in this space. Then remembering that i was really in my own world here. 
What did I see! Very much like looking through different kaleidoscopes into bright light. The shapes were mostly circles, and then triangles. Most of them from this dark focus point in front of me. I also had a milky way sometimes in front of me like a line of bubbles, mostly red, green or purple - stretching from left to right for a time. The flashes were not comfortable all of the times, but they led to a relax of tension in me. "
"Kaleidoscopic blues, purples, oranges, quite overwhelming at times. I didn’t see anything that was solid or seemed “real” but I had the impression that there was something larger and more complex happening behind the kaleidoscope that I couldn’t quite resolve. Intense and maybe a little sinister!
I got distracted by the music eventually - the effect of the low frequencies at the loudest parts - vibrating ribs! - was really pleasant. "
"Sometimes it was like a static television channel that would travel me to different spaces through circular time warps that were full of colour. I was touched by a darker moment with a purple piece of land that had a hole in it, and this hole crumbled to get bigger and bigger. Until the purple land was gone. At one point I saw a face, maybe my face, in bright yellow and red, and I went inside my face travelled into it, into my molecules, my pores, my everything. 
I looked at the galaxy from afar. I looked in the sun. i cried a single tear of euphoria (?) nostalgia (?) sadness (?). It was an experience I didn’t want to end. But I should add I saw an explosion of colour that seemed like the end of something - a place, a thought, an existence. It was moving literally and figuratively. "
"I felt like I stepped into a kaleidoscope, also I wasn’t moving. Sometimes when the light went really white and bright it felt like the seating was tilting. A bit like the turn of the kaleidoscope that started spinning faster and slower changing from clockwise to counterclockwise. 
It felt like there was an urgency to the patterns like they needed to move at all times. However, the pattern always stayed within an axis of sorts. I believe the movement of the lights lined up with the beat of the music like visualisation of the sound. "
"I experienced a lot of abstract geometric shapes that seemed to contort and twist in time with the music. At times it was almost kaleidoscopic and it felt like I was moving forwards, almost as if through space. I wanted to draw the experience, but it was constantly moving so I’m not sure where I’d start. Sometimes it was moving in different directions at the same time, open with a central focal point. When it wasn’t moving, big swathes of orange light and purple light, sometimes blue or yellow were the overwhelming colour palette. Overall it was wholly enveloping and I’m keen to come again to see if I’d have the same experience. "
"It varied in geometric/ kaleidoscopic patterns, the most common was like looking down on hexagonal umbrella shapes. Each time the lights dimmed everything changes. First like a TV being turned off but later it was like a grid of bubbles that burst leaving a grid of dots. Many times shapes were not symmetrical, sometimes I was following a snaking line. Near the end, there were times it felt like I was under water looking up at the surface getting closer but never reaching it. 
The most tangible shape I saw was a pyramid, the lines of it’s shape seemed like every colour and pulsing and at the top there was intense pulsing black and white a lot like an eye in Illuminati confirmed. "
"Very bright, intense powerful colourful lights - at points it was lamost too intense and felt almost inescapable - reminded me of an intense visuals-heavy acid trip which can produce the same feeling of being trapped and unable to escape however once I relaxed more and stopped focusing so hard on keeping my eyes closed it became less intense. At times it felt like I could feel the heat of the sun when the lights were bright and not flashing and at other times it was like I could feel someone standing over me close to my face or someone walking across the room in my peripheral vision. All in all, a weird, strange, class experience. What I imagine DMT is like. "
For the most part the experience was very relaxing. As the music and lights intensified I felt my body go heavy and my breathing became very shallow. I started to see people in the lights; at the start they waved across the bottom of my view; they centralised and it was almost as if the patterns and lights stemmed from the figures. I did lose focus multiple times and my brain started to produce almost dreams in which I recognised people instead of lights at the most intense parts but not in the sense of being scared or the lights being too much - it was just like a weird feeling. 
"First of all, I felt really relaxed, I could see some dots and spots according to the lights changing and the music. Some random thoughts were running throughout my mind and later I concentrated on my breathing so I felt more relax and thought about the calm music and the lights flashing so that I was able to see some random pictures, dots forming some mountains or something. But apart from the daily routine, a busy schedule, it was really relaxing state of mind to increase the concentration. "
"Beginning with experiencing grid-like moving images, in blue and red, progressing to other colours and star-shaped grid movements. When the light subsided the after image was at some points a deep indigo blue with rippling grids or a deep turquoise blue with rhomboid grids or ripples. 
The experience was meditative, so after a while I began to drift off into imagined images like ripples on the sandy shore or wave like patterns in a yellow sky. At it’s height I experienced an alternating vivid blue and red with broken jagged lines (also curves), like a cityscape but with parts missing. It felt like I could complete the cityscape if I could fill in the gaps. "
"I actually found it quite distressing. I was feeling panicked from the flashing checkerboard lights that were really intense. I tried not to focus on anything and then I felt quite woozy - like a roller coaster track. 
I seen people walking past and peering into the “burrow” I was in - this made me think I was in another reality and unconscious or something bad - not at dreamachine - but then someone coughed and I felt ok. 
There were moments of pure bliss - golden yellow sun on my body - really warm and soft but this was only small burst that slipped away like liquid. Lost of red and blue checkerboard with an eye in the centre. "
"Red and gold triangle cosmic flashing kaleidoscope, the triangles grew and shrank in size before melting away like and being blown away. 
Blue, green and gold sand puzzles. Journey as if water was being poured through. The sand shifted before melting away. 
Extreme peace and relaxation. "
"Initially it was like dawn waking up at sunrise. It made me smile - I felt happy. Then lights - colours - mostly blue/ green/ purple/ some pink - fast slow - flowing like a stream - the way sunlight reflects off water - if felt calm, peaceful. I wondered if this is how dying might feel like. Then soaring colour - big sheets of purple and blue - I could feel wind in my hair - then the river flow of dots and circles of tight, flowing in all directions. I felt happy. 
At some point I think I fell asleep. Woke up but no confusion, still felt happy. I wondered if this is how travelling through space may be like. Felt calm. Then it was over. Dawn to dusk. "
"It was an experience, I loved it. I feel relaxed and you can you’re going into the multiverse and through the time travelling future like you’re on the steam train going through the pixels, colours and through the tube tunnels like I'm going to have a wonderful future like my successful things at the University of Edinburgh and going through over the real imagination world and finally married in the future. I feel pull through and travelling into the amazing world in dreamland. I had a nice dream experience. It was the best. "
"Floating into space - like flying through at a super speed. Like warpspeed. 

Everytime we come from darkness into bright light it was like emerging from a dark tunnel into wonderful warm light floating without any cares. 

Very vivid colours - red, yellow, orange, purple, green, grey and black. 
When I was bathed in warm bright yellow light it made me feel warm and content like on a beach on a desert island. "
"At the beginning there was quite a lot of white noise as would be seen on a TV set with no signal - later this morphed into a sequence of stars which I was moving through at high speed. 
There were constantly shifting amorphic shapes such as green and blue eyes, five-sided geometric patterns with blood vessels running through them, red and white flashing grids. 
A couple of more vivid images appeared towards the later stages of the experience. These were: a solitary chair sitting at the end of an empty stony beach, intricate engravings on a stone building. I discovered that I could control the colour and movement of the visions by adjusting the tightness of my closed eyes. 
At two points I experienced what I would refer to as a ‘body high’ which lasted around 20 seconds each time. "
"A lot of red light and geometric figures of all shapes! It was partially like looking through a shattered glass and partially flying through tunnels. 
I felt moving at speed through different turns and going up and down the tunnels like on a rollercoaster. I felt very calm throughout yet excited. At points there was a lot to take in with all the bright colours. "
"First of all very strong colours like orange to red, and green blue to black!
After a while, all colours mixed and matched and started flashing! 
Later, my breath became at ease, and I felt more comfortable, and all colours started to become lighter like yellow, pink and white, mostly bright colours!
Last I think I slept for a while!"
"Images evocative of the space travel/ interstellar/ hallucinating scene in 2011: space odyssey. Interlapping colours, shapes, and moods. Most of the time the images appeared circular with a central point/ generator, but the images occasionally moved around, making the experience feel less like it was something that I was watching, and more like something I was part of. 
The longer it went on for the more I felt like my own thoughts began to affect the visuals. It is hard to tell how much my own thoughts came to me naturally, or how much they were influenced by the visuals. Very occasionally I saw people, from the waist/ torso upwards walk in front of/ bend down to come to me. Overall it made me fairly relaxed and happy. Fairly. "
"Colours - predominantly orange, then yellow, green, purple, blue. Shapes expanding coming close, then moving away. Hexagons and triangles and circles. A dark centre a few times. Up close then drawing back into the distance. A lot of silver above my head which I was conscious of and could barely see. Like it was on the inside of a spaceship. "
"Orange yellow
Vibrant magenta
Colours amazing 
Nucleus 
From bottom up, as in above you. 
Chequered boxes. Fine fine purple. 
White lights - dancing 
Wondered - missing heat - as in bright yellow
Left eye - blind people. Could feel eyes flickers, eye lids, not seeing as in eyes closed 
Twice it was like colours of outline bursting through, quick like sped up image @ train station 
Lots of pulsing 
Trusting 
Want to look all around as in 360 sight of it. "
Guided meditation on breathing was good as a threshold crossing into the experience. I did fall into a light sleep after that then woke into flashing colours. Very digital like distinct patterns washing like waves and then changing directions. Swirling like galaxy in contrasting colours. Music and flash intensity guided the experience through crescendos and falls - ended on the most intense sapphire deep blue. Ending was just fade out. There was a moment in the experience of almost too much intensity but it quickly changed. 
"At first I felt quite overwhelmed and anxious but I’m used to this and so worked through it. Once I had relaxed I mainly saw kaleidoscopic shapes. Sometimes they were small and detailed and other times they were big and messy. They felt more refined as the experience went on. They felt far more refined during the main part than in the taster. Throughout I found it interesting to shift my (inner) gaze in terms of depth of focus - playing with either focusing on what was in front of me, then softening the focusing to try and see past that and let the whole picture wash over me more organically. At one point I saw a goldfish swimming. "
"I found I was able to relax quite easily. The shapes I saw were mostly hexagonal in various colours and sizes. There were more feather like shapes also. 
The scene spun clockwise and anticlockwise. Mostly the colours and shapes were uplifting. I was always relaxed and could have stayed longer. I seemed to be able to change the scene by looking up or down or to the side. 
Thanks, I enjoyed the experience. "
"It took me a wee while to relax and get my breathing corrected. Once the music and lights started I began at once to see lots of neon lights, interspersed with honeycomb-like bubble. Stars and rapidly moving lines shooting and right I saw a beautiful beach with sea that was an amazing electric blue, lots of movement. Very much like looking into a kaleidoscope. Very moving in a different way. Thoroughly enjoyed this experience. "
"My eyelids felt like liquid. As if they were externally open and I couldn’t close them. After a few minutes I couldn’t feel or move my body and then its as if it didn’t exist. As if i didnt exist. It felt euphoric and blissful. I felt like I was a sphere. 
The patterns I saw were kaleidoscopic, flashing blue, red, yellow and green mostly. It felt like travelling in space or some other dimension. When the lights stopped flashing I still saw colour and movement, mainly green spots and wispy purple smoke.
The experience felt like I was light (in weight) and happy but with the absence of being myself or anything physical at all. "
"Excellent piece of work, I was finding it hard not to get lost in thought but that was just my own current headspace. Everytime i came back to focus the visuals were great! Perhaps might be helpful to remind people who get distracted to come back to your breath to clear your mind. Saw so much cool shapes, colours and patterns! I would love to do it many more times! And to bring everyone I know! Very safe and comfortable environment too! I wanted to be pushed further though! Visually and sonically! Maybe you be an option for more hardcore for the thrill seekers !! :-) "
"The visual movements and explosion of colours that I experienced were mostly stimulated by the intensity of the sound. High volume more musical sounds as opposed to the soft sounds were the main stimulants. 
I saw a lot of red colours and green kaleidoscope imagery. Made me feel like I flew into space. I felt a sense of calm and relaxation that I would get after deep sleep. It was a good experience. "
"Manipulatable fractals, similar to what I’d see in bright light (eg sky) or very dark spaces (visual snow) felt like I could influence the pattern to the point of forming an object in the centre of my vision, or a fairly solid horizon, or like I was passing through a chasm. 
The colours moved between bright yellows, reds and blues, and occasionally pink on a grey-ish background. 
It felt like looking through one of those childrens toy carousels with slits in the side that create the impression of moving images, but for psychedelic visuals rather than moving images. "
"It looked a lot like the old Doctor Who intro, just times 500. A kind of rapidly moving context that would change colour. I also saw a lot of geometric patterns that reminded me of 60s and 70s geometrics. Circles, rounded squares in various contrasting colours. Yellows, greens, red and blues were most common. I also saw a fair amount of 3D spaces. Like I was falling through an early 30 video games. The x,y, and z axes would move independently, and I felt very small. Here it was more black and white polka dots. Feeling-wise, it was exciting, like an insight into my own mind. It was really cool to see something that aligned with how fast my thoughts usually go. I have ADHD. it was more a visual experience than an auditory one that made the inside of my brain feel slightly odd like after I’ve had a headache and woken up from a nap to sleep it off. "
"I saw flashes of light to complete darkness. Felt I was under the sky full of stars of glass in complete darkness. 
The lights were strobe light. I imagined that was in a desert, under the hot sun and felt the hot rays of sun touching my skin. 
Then, I drifted to an experience when I felt I was under the sea; aka scuba diving and then light was passing through the water and then waves of water. 
I saw then patterns and textures of my BOSS suit that I bought 2 weeks ago. "
"I felt connected to my body, like I was aware of being in my body and staring up into a screen, almost like a planetarium kind of feeling. 
A lot of spinning. At times I felt like I was spinning too but mostly I was looking into it. 
I feel like I maybe struggled to relax and like I was trying too hard to ‘see something’
I felt relaxed on walking out and like I wanted to smile. "
"Feel like swimming in open water, the sea. 
Felt like my horizon of vision was horizontally endless like a see the shapes for miles further than my normal field of vision. 
Felt comfortable at ease seemed to take a long time to come back to myself after it all ended. Wanted the experience not to end. 
Would like to draw but don't feel capable to pay true homage to the colours. "
"The sun sets as a precursor for our dream. Organic creativity shuts down, systems repair as they please. The sun rises and the circuitry awakens again, then shuts off again, awakens again as the sun continues to speed through the sky. Days whizz part in an instant and one experiences time as the mountains and rivers do. The earth view time differently and with indifference. We are, and always have been, at one with the endless cosmos. "
"Mosaic of geometric colours, flashing moving, sometimes lime of light like rain moving faster furious. Sometimes just colour with an eye shape, never anything natural or uneven, more like machine like changing from big blasts of colours, blues, oranges, reds green and then fracturing undo. Never really like a sky or natural light and often with a mad remix of ever changing colours. "
"It started out as very much just a collection of lights colours and patterns. But as the experience went on it became similar to the feeling of falling asleep, various personal thoughts and feelings came to the surface alongside insecurities I have about my relationships. I definitely felt myself falling asleep at several points, but the machine brought me back, and so the cycle would start again, but with different patterns turning into new images. 
Towards the end I remember the patterns turning into the visual of me underwater, crystal clear, as I moved towards the surface and broke it the scene transformed into a brightly lit sandstone cave and the water became a shallow stream running through it only to disappear moments later. So yeah, definitely a dream like experience! "
"Honeycomb target shapes and warm light. Forgetting to brother and moving flames in the distance and soaring place moving circles and slight nausea during fastest lights. 

I often experience stress in my work and home life. I struggle to “switch off”. My mind is often racing when I try to sleep. I wonder if a regular “dreamachine” would help me with this? I need to disconnect from time to time. "
"See
Perfect geometric patterns. Bright block colours.
Flashing millions of coloured spots, giving way to concentrated moving geometric shapes, and kaleidoscopic images. green, orange, purple, yellow, bright. 

Feel
Relaxed, happy. 

Think
Started out in front of my eyes. Then inside my brain. Then all over my body. I thought I was in my brain. "
"A yellow but seemingly full field of light, warm and healing. 
Then tunnels in the void. A cold endless space of mystery and peace where everything just IS. but at the same time it doesn't need to exist. The tunnel felt like a pre-existence state, a reminder of life force just being an observer. In contrast with the yellow field which was more like reassurance of the self. 
An ocean. Breathing force under the water. Static while watching. The world existing, moving and alive. Not merely an observer like in the void, but interacting with it from my place in the water. 
I lost my feeling of the seat, the blanket and the awareness of my surroundings. I was floating in the kaleidoscope of lights and shapes. I saw many stars too. 
I think I lost consciousness, I’m not sure. But somehow I HEALED from a couple of problems/ worries with deep roots inside which right now I cannot even remember. BUT I KNOW I went through those. I experienced them, re-processed them in a way. I feel good. "
"Lot of very bright colours - often red and blue
Shimmering geometric shapes, visually in a grid. 
Experience of going through a tunnel, blue rings with white outline/ shimmer going past me. Yellow light - felt like I was being warmed by sun in beautiful desert - somewhat euphoric. 
Three-pronged shape, white spokes on a red or blue background, rotating in a grid. 
More abstract patterns - areas of black amongst coloured background, like cracks in a rock. occasionally, in between flashes of colours, the sense of being in a large, black room/ space - vast - with some geometric structure in white. "
"I saw loads of different colours and patterns - shapes that I hadn’t seen before. They were dynamic and changed with the music. There were lots of line with interlocking colours and the formations would spin. It was a really intense and amazing experience. I let my body relax and my mind wander, and reached a near-sleep stage. I felt hyperaware of my body, the space and the music. It was a relaxing and restful experience. "
"It was quite weird. At first, the strong light was making me uncomfortable but with time it became a kaleidoscope of bizarre visual experience. I think I didn’t fully experience it because I might have fallen asleep but I’m not sure. 
Especially at the beginning, the colour, shape and pattern experience was remarkable. "
"24/08/22 - Belfast
The strobe lighting was a little too intense for me. 
It was difficult to maintain the focus so I was compelled to use the eye mask. 
I moved the eye mask up and down to see if I could get accustomed to the intensity of the light but I couldn’t adjust to an acceptable level. 
Unfortunately, I had to abandon the experience after the initial test period. "
"Bright orange to the side like sunrise. 
Grids, teal, darkness at times. Almost seeing faces - but not recognisable. Feeling like science. Objects moving through space towards me - fast! 
Lilac. 
Moving at speed along a cable or tunnel. 
Skin on cheeks tingling. Relaxed. Asleep. Snoring. Awake. Other peoples’ breathing. Relaxed. HAPPY. "
I think the experience was like a time of reflection and the colours to me represented different emotions I had felt in my life and you could begin to associate the colours with periods and it was interest to see how that changed as I reflected through. Certain colours were very prominent. There was no main patterns for me it was like a kaleidoscope of colours constantly changing. 
"Space looks like something from a Stanley Kubrick film (love that!)
When lights were brighter I tended to get warmer colours, starting with primary colours at the beginning, however as the experience went on the colours became more complex. 
Darker moments were accented by warm blues, almost like a rich lapiz lazuh blue (MARY Blue) 
Patterns emerging into a more chaotic repeat. Almost like the patterns you could find on 1960s textile design on your granny’s peg bag. "
"Relaxing, relaxing and pleasurable. 
Did briefly fall asleep but I didn’t want to miss anything so I awoke to enjoy the patterns and colours. Very often the colours gravitated back to purples and violet. The most dramatic colour was orange. As I moved through the sequences, the start colour was mostly red with occasion blue. The patterns were very varied and not easy to explain. The pattern in the introduction were much more distinct. Definite triangles followed by squares. Only occasion circular patterns. They all did move or rotate. 
All was so varied, that there was no single picture to draw. A superbly restful experience. "
"I saw a lot of checkerboard colours and lights varying from dark black to warm whites and almost so bright as looking at the sun. 
As it went on I seen a lot of blues and greens that looks like spirals and shapes similar to kaleidoscope. Shapes of flowers and arrows became stronger and stronger throughout. As time passed, I found myself want to smile and could feel my body wanting to be lifted off the seat. At the stage colours reminded me of the sky, sea and forests. Throughout there were distinct shaped tiles and tunnels with almost a black hole in the middle. Shapes went from dots, to squares, and ranged through many colours and always spiralled into the centre. "
"Very intense and at times uncomfortable. My brain felt like it was working overtime to make sense of whatever I was seeing. 
Mainly red in colour with cross shape in the centre of white - sometimes it moved like in a vortex motion and my head was spinning. I saw a lot of honeycomb shapes. 
At the very end I saw red, then changed to orange and then yellow and in the last moments I saw a bright serene blue - the only time I saw that colour in the whole experience. "
"I could see many different colours and shapes, mostly diamonds or squares - moving very fast and spinning in circles. At times, I could see a shape/ figure of a newborn baby? To my left hand side. As the show went on, then I could make out more figures at either side of me. It was hard to see their face but they were walking towards me and then walking away. At one point, the figure to my left was holding a baby - it felt as though they were standing beside me watching the light show too. Again hard to make out their face - but it appeared they were smiling. On my right, there appeared to be a figure of a woman sitting on a sofa, standing and sitting. At times, I felt I was falling through a long, colourful sphere. The shapes and colours were moving in circular motion, faster and slower at times. I felt like I was looking at a dancefloor at tmes. The music changed the speed/ rhythm of the lights. "
"I could see many different shapes and patterns. A recurring one was red lights flickering in the shape of a heart.  Now and again, a grey shadow/ mist would appear for a brief moment that resembled a person, an elderly person, perhaps a relative. 
Another recurring feeling was that I was staring into shallow clear water, as if I was on the edge of a boat or pier just before the room would fade to black. 
A surreal experience that made me feel reflective. Almost like an out-of-body experience that took some adjusting to. Incredibly interesting and provoking. "
I saw a night sky with stars. Also the most beautiful colour and energy. Orange - which made me smile. I felt totally relaxed and think I may have fallen asleep at the end because I forgot what I had seen for a few minutes. The colours were so vivid - some like a kaleidoscope blues - greys - purples - greens - yellows - reds - oranges - some vibrations in and out - coming close then moving back. I felt part of the universe when I saw the night sky - and in the presence of angels. I am very happy that I took part in this experiment and would definitely do it again. Feel very relaxed and happy. Thank you. x
"Very relaxed, nice colours and shapes - intense then fading. At one stage there was a sound like a rotating which transformed into a visual shape of this. Overall - a very different experience to anything I have done. "
"Bright yellow, orange and red - like walking into bright sunshine. 
An out of focus portrait at the centre of a long tunnel that I travelled toward but never got closer to. 
Lots of bright colours often in honeycomb patterns. 
Then at times darkness. 
Sometimes I felt slightly anxious or think that I had forgotten to breath, but was able to return to the guided breath pattern. 
At the end I wasn’t sure if I had been awake the whole time or if I had fallen asleep. 
Glad to have taken part. Thank you. "
"Relaxing, feeling like in and out of different states and emotions. It seemed music enabled me to navigate deeply into different states of being. The light combination appeared to open also different areas of reflection. The sounds of the bells it is also given me a sense of awakening. Peace also was felt. Connection to the moment while half asleep. Breathing was felt as relevant to the experience as colours and sounds. 
Feeling of ocean and greatness, and sky and infinite were evoked. "
"Shooting through an endless kaleidoscope of merging and changing colours of shapes that expanded and deflated. Large tubes and tunnels that were snake like that I entered into and also saw moving around me. A large pink glow that enveloped me and soft white cloud-like shapes that moved around. 
At points the kaleidoscope tunnel felt as though it shifted and turned and I turned with it. "
"Peacocks at the periphery of a kaleidoscope of rainbows. Hexagonal and shimmering prisms of colours. Soft sunrise and sunsets, with shapes and geometric forms. I also saw the white outline of an ant eater! Or maybe it was a bear, and butterflies. 

I found that I enjoyed the experience more when my mind began to waner and I wasn’t thinking about where I was, which I guess is the point? It was then that I think the shapes and colours and movement began to become more intense. It reminded me of being a passenger in a car on a really sunny day, passing by trees and the strobing light effect upon my eyes. Movement through time and space. "
"Geometrical shapes, moving/vibrating. All colours merging, like a kaleidoscope. I saw pronounces in the centre of my field of vision, a yellow cross, into a union jack style six lines. Concentric circles around * like symbol. 
I meditated/ stretched, many thoughts of coming walk, etc. problem-solving solutions. Enjoyed being in the moment. 
Felt calm, and allowed mind to wander. 
Different, imagined myself in a european worlds far, turn of last century! :-)  "
"At the very end i saw a faint white image of the brains neural state existence point, like a very faint sponge - like nonsense. Orange, a subsequently orange like peel effects of smaller and larger space. I thought what if this is what heaven is like, heaven is like just an eternal everchanging landscape of unstimulating stimulai. BOOM. 
I saw triangle peaks, stacked within eachother apex first, then downward arrows stacked. The left-facing “God is a geometer Plato” "
"I felt like I was constantly travelling through a square tunnel like vectors at points these felt like there were blue particles appearing and pulling my focus. The light was warmth. I just constantly felt in a flow, but still. I don’t know why but it reminded me of crimes and brought me back to when I was a teen and watching crime films on channel 4 at midnight. Towards the end I felt like my imagination was getting away from me as I saw people but their outline was neon green and blue (like they had glow sticks). I was relaxed and could have stayed long as it was really comfortable and chilled. I felt quite at peace. "
"Octagonal structures appearing in peripheral vision then quite precise edges to these shapes but they vanished, making way for more ‘lava lamp’ type visions, and distant landscapes. Large perspectives framed by craggy cliff like edges that were soft and shifting. Often a circle of people appeared in these landscapes and I realised it wasn’t the circular shape I’d imagined but the space we were in. "
"Pinpoints extending into pac-man lines, a pulsating illuminated triangle in the centre with red and blue beams radiating out. A collection of large spheres, fuzzy, soft - orange and pink. A sense of being an insect, a tiny insect, on a frame - either a mirror or a picture frame. It was ornate, gold filigree. 
There was a man (head and shoulders like a cameo) he had a hat on and had a long fringe swept to one side. His expression was enigmatic. 
I saw atomic structures, like a drawing from a chemistry textbook. Hexagonal, extending like the roots of a tree underground. 
Connected, we are all connected. I cried. 
Neon green right angles on a black background. So many images that barely registered before it then evolved into something else. "
"The experience was very relaxing with moments of high intensity. I felt connected in the emerging bright lights at the start sensing the presence of God. as the lights and noise continued my mind wandered to various places of relaxation and then anxiety and the lights and shapes matched that of the feelings. When there was anxiety, the shapes were sharper and more refined and as the mind relaxed the shapes and colours softened. 
Very mind exercise and nice to experience complete relaxation in my whole body as I left. 
Thank you! "
"Felt very secure. Relaxed. Moments of elation. 
So many colours and energy. The music seemed to enhance the experience. Not sure how much time passed. Very restful and relaxed. Never taken a ‘trip’ but it was like looking through a kaleidoscope so much colour. 
Did not want it to end. Would love to rest here for an hour or longer. The music felt it was surrounding me like a hug. 
Beautiful and very enlightening. :-) "
"I saw lots of abstract shapes and colours that morphed into other shapes and colours. It reminded me of the spiro giro set my brother had when I was wee. And it reminded me of looking into a kaleidoscope, and of a mandala and of a hand made bracelet a friend had that changed shape when you lightly pressed on it. I saw differently coloured honeycombs and the pupil of my eye grow and then fade into other scenes. At the very start I saw flames - small, light flames - that morphed into the next scene. And I fell asleep for I don’t know how long - and woke up knowing I’d had a really interesting, animated story but it was just out of my reach and I couldn’t bring it back. "
"Calm and safe, cocooned, womb-like. At points it got intense and at one point felt a little frightening but mostly my own mental state was relaxed and calm. The only mental image I had was of my brother and his wife's wedding picture which I was looking at today as it's their anniversary. He died last October so this has been a day to think about him a little. I thought at the point I saw flames and leaves but really not completely in focus. I could have stayed in it a lot longer, would have been happy there all night! It felt weightless, maybe like floating in space or being underwater. "
"At the start, the really bright orange light was hard to “see” but as it went on it got easier/ my eyes got used to it. I felt some full-body “vibrations” through the music and light. I saw mainly abstract shapes throughout but some of them mixed with my memories or thoughts like that of a man in a green suit on a beach with the pattern in front of him obscuring the view of him. 
Towards the end, I felt like I was drifting off into sleep. "
"I seen fractalised light pulsating similar to a flow of water. Colours pulsated between red, black, blue, yellow and green. Within the experience I seen a “shadow” man silhouette. Showed its shape in a dark purple with singular intense orange light. Coming from the centre of its head. Great experience, no threat was felt from the shadow man. Extemely relaxing, I would so again. "
"Amazingly detailed repeated structures, sometimes square tiles, sometimes hexagonal (like honeycomb). Often the colours alternated between every other tile on successive flashes. 
At some points it reminded me of the title sequence of the original Dr Who, or the multiple-image effect using a similar technique in the Bohemian Rhapsody video but in stunningly high saturation colour (again the multiple tiling theme repeating over the whole of my view). 
Another repeated structure theme, near the start, was similar to the radiating rows of decorative ‘bosses’ on the inside of say a cathedral dome. I was fascinated by how DETAILED some of these repeated structures were. 
Near the end I became aware of the whole view spinning clockwise, but almost as soon as I noticed it that seemed to cause the spin to stop and reverse anti-clockwise. "
"At first I was trying to analyse everything that I was seeing or feeling, with a change in music my mind kind of swingled into a different mode and shapes started to turn up. I saw a grid made out of triangles that shaped and evolved into different things. From a brain it zoomed out and build a landscape. I recognise the landscape from a trip I took with a friend hiking at the north coast. I thought of the animals we saw that day and in that second a red flash happened through the picture. Like a bunny we saw that day just dragging behind the air. I thought this was unreal and in that moment the landscape and scene morphed again crumbling into shapes. "
"In the beginning, a soft glow of pink came into my vision and I felt soft. I imagined myself as a baby in the womb and how calming it was. As the experience progressed, my visions became more intense and vibrant: swirls of colours bursting across my mind. I felt as thought I was zooming through the universe but at the same time it felt so peaceful. I was moving towards a point of a rainbow colours before it would disappear and new patterns and colours would replace it. I felt fluid, happy to move with the pace and patterns. I feel different coming out of the experience, a new yet familiar feeling of understanding. Thank you :-) "



"At the start, the really bright orange light was hard to “see” but as it went on it got easier/ my eyes got used to it. I felt some full body “vibrations” through the music and light. I saw many abstract shapes throughout but some of them mixed with my memories or thoughts like that of a man in a green suit on a beach with the pattern in front of him obscuring the view of him. Towards the end, I felt like I was drifting off into sleep"
"Amazing bright colours - bright bright orange, electric blue!
Bright yellow like the sun coming up in the desert - could feel the warmth from the sun.
When there were lots of colours ______ it felt like the chaos of walking through the souks in Marrakech.
Overall feeling of warmth, calm, well-being.
Best light show than any major concert or anything I have ever seen
Calm"
"Geometrical shapes, moving/vibrating all colours merging, like a kaleidoscope. I saw _____ in the centre of my field of vision, a yellow cross, into a union jack style six lines * (star drawing) covered in circles around like a ____.
I hesitated/ stressed, many thoughts of the coming week etc - problem solving solutions. Enjoyed being in the moment.
Felt calm, allowed mind to wander.
Different, imagined myself in a ___ worlds fair, turn of last century! :)
"
"The experience was very relaxing with moments of high intensity. I felt connected; the emerging bright lights at the start sensing the presence of god. As the lights and noise continued my mind wandered to various places of relaxation and the anxiety and the lights and shapes matched that of the feelings. When there was anxiety, the shapes were sharper and more centred and as the mind relaxed the shaped and colours shattered
Very mindful exercise and nice to experience complete relaxation in my whole body as I left
Thank you.
"
"Bright yellow, orange & red - like walking into bright sunshine
An out of focus portrait at the centre of a long tunnel that I travelled toward but never got closer to
Lots of bright colours often in honeycomb patterns
Then at times darkness
Sometimes I felt slightly anxious or think that I had forgotten to breathe, but was able to return to the guided breath pattern
At the end I wasn’t sure if I had been awake the whole time or if I had fallen asleep.
Glad to have taken part.
Thank you"
"Felt very secure. Relaxed. Moments of elations. 
So many colours and energy.
The music seemed to enhance the experience.
Not sure how much time passed.
Very restful and relaxed. Never taken a ‘trip’ but it was like looking through a kaleidoscope so much colour
Did not want it to end. Would love to rest here for an hour or longer. The music felt like it was surrounding me like a hug
Beautiful and very enlightening :)."
"I felt like I “saw” the music playing
I was impressed with the feeling that my consciousness was faced to “play” with the music.
The description of dance “as music we can see” came to me.
Sometimes when I meditate I can see “tunnels” that I travel through, in the Dream Machine the tunnels seemed to come to life. Usually they are dark in appearance, with no colour or texture or life force. Here these tunnels danced and twirled and appeared in beautiful shimmering colours. 
Beauty in motion
Thank you"
"At first, I seen lots of shapes. Probably every type of shape I’ve ever seen. I seen one colour lead into the next. White into green, into blue, vivid red, purple, yellow, gold. I was travelling fast through the universe in the centre of a light orb. I seen trillions of stars through the gaps and ahead of me what seemed like an angel guiding me with light pulsing out of it. I was travelling fast and could see stars above and below fly past. I seen symbols in the rocks and what looked like the Nazea lines in the shape of animals. I seen a side profile of a face in pink/purple. It felt/looked like a kaleidoscopic flower with colour at the centre and one thing/image connected to the next. I seen figures in the white light. I felt total peace and comfort. It felt like I slipped into a dream. My last image was of an older woman. I think I was talking to her but she was gone when the Guardian spoke again."
"Very hard to explain specifically what I saw… There were a lot of tunnels leading into each other, turning into one huge kaleidoscope. Every time I closed my eyes harder, this again radically changed my visuals. I have left with a feeling of serenity; this was a genuinely beautiful experience. Thank you for giving the opportunity. 
Also, Jon Hopkins was a perfect candidate to soundtrack the experience.
"
"I felt generally really relaxed, figuring out different images. I try to explain them as follows
I feel like travelling in a tunnel of light, green and red. When music was melodic the tunnel was really clear but when music became as only a loud disturbing sound; all colour mixed up
When lights go down I saw a coloured (blue) cloud
With high intense light I felt uncomfortable (I started moving my fingers and feet) and I see only a white cloud with fast moving black mark
At ¾ time of the experience I started again to travel in a tunnel, this time with white and yellow light, as in point 1, it changed with the disturbing sound
At the end, with extremely relaxing sound I saw a cloud of yellow light

PS: When I write “travelling in a tunnel” is like we see in futuristic movies
PPS: In pictures 1 and 2 there is a black mole at the centre
"
"Feeling of motion, moving through a tunnel, constant moving towards. Some visions - family, an ostrich! Changing from dark to light, pink blobs featured as did an eye, pink then white/ lilac, lilac spots on white, black dust? Moving around like a tv channel of sorts! Saw a sunset sky, clouds and colours. My head did hurt a bit but it was relaxing. I felt myself drifting into a dream at the end, saw an old house with a beekeeper. It feels like stepping inside the consciousness and experiencing it as a flow, a constant changing picture of colour and image felt very relaxed after. The more I concentrated on my breath the more vivid things were, more movement etc. Felt happy, calm, at peace. Felt the tangible sense that ‘life’ and conscious life is a journey moving forwards in constant motion, ever changing, but rich and beautiful, if you choose to see it.
"
"I felt like I was in a dream, floating through space and time. I saw lots of reds, oranges, yellows and a blue night sky with white stars. Near the beginning of the experience I went through a spinning circular tunnel of red circles and blue waves. I saw a lot of waves of red light and an intense movement when I saw lots of oval shapes of yellow light surrounded by bright orange light and that was surrounded by bright red lights. Near the end of the experience I saw something that resembled a static screen."
"Many things that made me feel like I was in a bright __ painting. Mostly felt like I was falling at speed down a tube (like a water park) towards a small scene in the end. Sometimes I could see I was travelling towards the sea. The walls of the tube were changeable. Mostly it was made up of round balls like a ball pit. In the background (behind the ballsO there were white capital letters. Overall there was brief moments where it felt like too much, but mostly it was relaxing & I continue to feel relaxed now. There was a point during the taster where it looked like I was watching the night sky. Predominant colours were blue/ teal / white/ purple ___ of red"
"My experience started with a warm orange glow-, thought of sunrise in the morning, hitting my eyes though closed eyes. ____, saw grid-like graphic patterns - stripes, lines and chequerboard patterns in pink, red, green and orange colour. I felt calm and relaxed throughout; my mind wandered and I thought about many things. It wasn’t at all what I was expecting - I imagined I would see organic shapes and it was amusing how much of what I was was straight lines and patterns. I do a lot of yoga and am used to breathing exercises - this kept me feeling grounded and at ease throughout. Really interesting experience. Thanks!"
"Felt at peace, that everything would be ok. Felt relaxed and no pain or tension in my body. Everything external melted away. Felt like I had a great rest and woke up feeling refreshed
Saw lots of geometric shapes in mostly blue, but also red, purple and yellow. Some more distinct shapes like grids of dots and hexagons, others overlaid each other like circles like looking through a kaleidoscope as a child
"
"When I first started the experience I didn’t know what to expect. When I closed my eyes I felt relaxed and excited. I first saw the sun rising above the horizon on what looked like a savannah. The light quickly turned to a myriad of patterns, some hexagonal, some rhombus, all different shapes and colours. I saw stars, both like this (big star drawing) and this (small dots drawing). My favourite part was when I felt like I was falling through the stars in the night sky. I also saw what looked like an ancient nation with symmetrical pillars and I felt like I was falling through an ancient Greecian palace. I saw windows from floor to ceiling and white pillars. Another favourite was the little pink elephants I was walking in hexagonal shapes :D
I felt quite amazed at what my brain can do and I really enjoyed my experience.
"
"Mainly pink, purple & red colours that blended. Sometimes blobs, sometimes like water ripples. There were a few occasions when there were no colours - no visual - just blackness. It wasn’t like a just close your eyes and blackness, it felt heavy and for a split second the first time it happened, it felt strange, almost like an anxious feeling that the colour had left. Then the other occasions it happened, it felt okay. Overall it felt so calming and my eye balls felt quite heavy and my legs felt heavy walking. Would love to experience it again!
"
"It started with a large sun dawning. Then it felt like there were lots of people building bricks really fast. Lots of regular geometric shapes on top of one another. As the music got more intense and louder I could see lots of crosses forming, ornate fancy crosses like Maltese Crosses or celtic crosses. Each piece faded into a Kaleidoscope before more shapes formed. I was surprised at the range of colours. Lots of primary colours like blue and red colours I'm not naturally drawn to. It ended in greens and oranges but with an overlap of white crosses like someone had scribbled over the images. At first I was a bit nervous but in the end I found it very relaxing even though the images and sounds were fast paced."
"It was like there was a plug inside my mind that was unplugged, with every breath in/out, time would speed up - my body/ vision would drum more quickly into the plug. I wasn’t emptying though, then there was infinity, more where it came from.
My stomach also churned as I felt like there a similar plug there that similarly twisted my body as it struggled to be trained compared to the mind"
"It was a strange experience. A times was floating in space. Sometimes I felt warm and full of joy. Other times I felt a little afraid and not in control.
Sometimes My mind mind wandered to early childhood memories that seemed very random. 
I think I will think about the experience - and reflect on it for some time. I found I couldn't draw the experience - too much going on and hard to get meaningful or coherent sense right now is how I feel. "
"At the beginning it felt very interse, like I was losing control and floating, but then it felt as if I was being shown secret information from the universe that was always inside of me and I  was being reminded of it.
It also felt as if we were all on a journey together and although it was a very individual experience, I felt very connected to others and as if we were breathing and knowing as one.
It also felt like being inside a music kaleidoscope, visualised and made me think the digital version pales in comparison.
It was extremely psychedelic, and went from being intense to amazing and I didn't want it to end."
"This is my second time and I came back to see if I would have a more colourful experience than yesterday.
I have to say I was only aware of there being white light which came and went.
I had some awareness of bluey/purple for a very brief moment but that was the only colour I experienced.
I found the experience very relaxing as I loved the music but I was disappointed that my experience wasn't more colourful. It might be my eyes? I've had optic neuritis in both eyes due to multiple sclerosis so I don't know if that might affect my ability colour??
I still enjoyed it but am I weird??"
"It felt like I stepped into a kaleidoscope, also I wasn’t moving. Sometimes when the light went really white and bright it felt like the seat was tilting. A bit like the turn of the kaleidoscope that started spinning faster and slower changing from clock-wise to anti clock wise.
It felt like there was an urgency to the patterns like they needed to move at all times. However the pattern for we always stayed within an axis of sorts.
I believe the movement of the lights lined up with the beat of the music like a visualisation of the sound.
"
"A million beauties of the world.
Perspective, gratefulness of what I’ve expanded so far in my life. 
Layers - seeing through the shapes, colours, and motions to find deeper hidden meaning. Searching for answers?
Control yet no control. I can conjure what I see yet I have no control of the order, pattern, intensity etc. 
Therapeutic - would love to see more of this available to people who are struggling mentally. 
This is YOUR space and no one can penetrate that. The beauty is beyond imagination and to see that when all you see is grey is so important."
"There were loads of patterns & colours. Swirls, spots, leopard print (in pink & green or pink & brown). I saw all the colors of the rainbow in various shades of intensity from pastel to deep jewel tones. I felt relaxed even though my my brain was still full of chatter although the chatter became more focused like an audio description of what I could see.
Lights travelling in darkness like slow to warp speed in space. "
"Space looks like something from a Stanley Kubrick film (love that!).
When lights were brighter I tended to see warmer colours, starting with primary colours at the beginning, however as the experience went on the colours became more complex.
Darker moments were accented by warm blues, almost like a rich lapez lazuli blue (MARY blue).
Patterns emerging more organically into a more chaotic repeat. Almost like the patterns you could find on a 1960s textile design on your granny’s peg bag. "
"When the music was lighter and smooth at the beginning I was feeling relax and enjoying the environment and peace. 
When the music was louder I was thinking of the busy life we have and we didn’t hear any other thing than noise, cars, traffic, stress, routines, discussions with everyone, anxiety. Beauty at the same time enters in our lives which it doesn't allow us to listen to the real world to the people. When the lights were off and on I was feeling like re-born and try again to live this life better. Enjoy more and remove more stress
It doesn’t worth it in The end.
when the music were again lighter, smooth then I was back to the relax time, forgetting the stress, busy life and enjoying the moment what I have. This experience gave me back what I should focus in my life and what I should ignore more.
1. The life is too short!"
"“Tree of life” musical trip. Sound experience.
I saw my life passing by at the side of my partner. Little moments that conform a human experience. The soundtrack of our lives. Beautiful and deep.
PD: I missed a little sound intensity. I would like it was a little lusher. 
I will ask him to come experience Dreamachine with me.
Thank you. This is what I needed today. Forever grateful."
"When the lights turned on, slowly from darkness I saw deep purple, fading into blue and then yellow like a sunrise as the music swelled. When the lights flashed I saw spiralling checkerboards of deep red and black which made me feel uneasy, but then this transformed into a spiral of yellow and white which was more calming. I kept thinking about ‘how to think’ in order to get the most out of the experience, whether I should actively search for shapes and passively daydream. I felt much more calm when I passively daydreamed. Overall it was a very relaxing experience and there was a lovely sense of togetherness amongst the group. "
"It was quite beautiful living in the soundscape for a little bit, I think I could listen to it at home to relax to, or to set an atmosphere about the house. The music sounded like that from the Game Journey which was lovely. 
The lightscape was almost hypnotic and mesmerizing to be wrapped up in. It was a nice balance of 'heavy effects at the start /middle, followed by the ""light"" colour scapes at the end. Most of the time, it felt like floating in space, with and being surrounded by stars and the galaxy. Others, it felt like travelling through a vortex. There was a quick moment where I think I saw a heart, as well a moment where I could have sworn I saw a bunch of eyes. (At points, it definitely felt like I was a part of a Tool album cover. I’ve always wondered what goes through Danny Carey's mind to create the artwork he does, and I suppose I might finally have some idea.) Chaos can be peaceful, I guess.
Overall, the experience was excellent, I just wish I could relive it whenever I need to relax/destress. I really hope to get to partake in it (or something like it) again in the future. This will live with me, and I'm really thankful I got to be a part of it. Can't wait to see what might come next. Grma☺"


"Kaleidoscopic patterns           Endless ripples in every direction
Techno                                   Elation and joy
Aliens spaceship landing       Spinning
Tyre traces                             Like being in an intergalactic spaceship
Whipped cream
Red, blue and yellow and colours I’d never seen - bright, vivid
Indigo.                                    Like experiencing the big bang
An eye in the centre               Atomic structure
Fine lines and blobs in fractals"
"Weightless - like I was separate from my body.
Tired and full of sleep - like coming round from an anesthetic
The experience seemed to last forever yet simultaneously very short.
I saw shapes and patterns - then nothing at all; like my mind as sleeping even when I was conscious. The music would reignite the creation of pattern in my minds eye but the music and lights never seemed connected, always separate from one another
It was very peaceful; if death was this ethereal no one would fear it."
"Haunting - at times I felt as if I was seeing supernatural beings.
Fear - I could feel myself feelings as if I was falling into an abyss and nothing to hold on to
I felt as if I should be grabbing out for something to save me.

Calmness - at times I felt calm with the soft noise and soft more static shapes which I felt would be how it feels when you die and your soul leave the body.

I really enjoyed the experience and couldn’t believe the amount of light and colours visible to me. 
Than you "
"Pulsing lights, changing colours, vivid blues, reds, yellows, purple, black. 
Changing shapes, like watching something spinning.
Wow - reminded me of the start of “JOE 90” when he sits in the chair and that centrifuge thing spins around him!
Relaxed, almost like a sense of movement."
"Letters, checkboards at the beginning felt like rollercoaster, spinning wheels sticky wall rides in the middle, towards the end grass, flowers
colours of purple and teal like I hadn’t seen before. Felt very fast
Also- felt physical sensations for sure - back and neck, face, tingly.
Loved it! 
at the start felt like a typewriter coming apart and spinning
Also felt very short! felt like 10 min"
"Nothing profound, but I enjoyed the tie-dye patterns. 
Tie-dye with lots of Maltese crosses on me
Fabric. Primarily reds and pinks, no yellows, blues or greens. 
I think the audio alone might have had a deeper impact. My mind was busy trying to decipher light  patterns and it was distracted by that a bit. 
I felt a sense of wellbeing and increased generosity of spirit for everyone in the room.
It occurred to me that this could be good to do post-crisis - to give you some moments of detachment and sinking into nothingness."
"I felt very relaxed and aware of a changing sense of inner space, particularly, I think, under blue lights
I felt on the brink of outer space on several occasions, including a sense of travelling in space for a few memorable moments.
Occasionally, I felt I was inside or part of a lava lamp but there were also moments where I was aware of little additionally apart from the light and sound. I meditate a lot (™) and wondered whether my habit or a innerlight prevented greater stimuli from occurring"
"I felt that I was following something
To a new place
I was aware of things, people around me then they were gone
Thoughts broke into the journey
But then brought me back to journey
Several time bright light bathed us
I felt actual joy
Other time I thought I was being left behind
I felt sad, even panic
but then I was back on the journey I got somewhere, somewhere new
It was a calm place, somewhere I wanted to be. I could have stayed there when it ended, I felt separated a little from my body my limbs heavy, I have to reconnect "
"Initially felt tense - deep breathing helped me to relax - I was thinking of yoga sessions and tried to relax deeper - soon I felt myself letting go - the music was relaxing- I definitely had lots and lots of dreams - racing - I can’t really say what I dreamt off - I can’t remember but I was indifferent world/dimensions with different people - maybe celebrities / movie stars - I can’t really say - I definitely was very relaxed - warm - comfortable - I feel asleep often times
I awake to horrible alarm sounding noises - repetitive noises and harsh lights - I couldn’t get back to sleep. I was fully aware of surroundings and looking around the room - was definitely an immersive experience - would love to do it again, I have no idea how long it lasted, maybe 30-40 mins, overall very therapeutic. The sun came up and an alarm sounded. I was wide awake, I can’t wait to do the high sensory. "
"The dream machine, to me, felt as though it were pulling at memories without fully revealing them. There  was an eeriness to this end  …. , I could not put my finger on it nor did I really care. I was comfortable, relaxed and separated from the world for a short time. 
Time  too felt manipulated. If the real lead lady had walked in and said it had been three days I would have been surprised, if she had said it had been five minutes the feeling would be the same. 
I saw blue skies, different shades of the sun, the experience felt, ultimately like a worship of sound and light whereby the two were showing off and manipulating time while I marveled and appreciated it "
"Colours mainly warm orange. 
Some blue, green, grey, black, red. Multitude and shapes - honeycomb, circles, patterns approaching, receding. 
Not discomfort but not peaceful or soothing. was aware of my breathing - did not lose touch with reality.
Thought of flickering light bulbs, poor TV reception
Is this what disco -goers experience? Found vibrations from sound very strong - did vibrations change what I saw - colours and shapes?"
"It’s almost impossible to describe all the visualizations I experienced. They came and went in a flash - at least most of them . Some lingered and then faded away. The drawings are what I “think” I saw or what I remember I think I saw. 
Even now the images are all merging together in my brain and  I fear in an hour or so, I will only vaguely remember anything. Like a dream fading into the ether. Remembering the memory rather than the actual event. 
I feel the images depend on the speed of the light changing, and the frequency of the sound. Each combination contains (producing) a different image…"
"Lots of coloured stars mostly yellow mint green all on the right side and a vivid sky blue top left. A pupil of an eye, possibly my pupil. A beautiful shade of purple thus filled the whole visual field. All of what I saw was divided into four even parts with mostly stars on the bottom right and hexagons above like bee hives. I felt very relaxed and quite sleepy when it was over. Felt I was flying through time 
Teresa Hudlow "
"Load of blue  and orange with star shape at centre. Also near the end like a sunflower not sure if I was dreaming. Didn’t really think much as if I was awake although I can't remember a lot of it. It was very enjoyable.  
I felt it was short period of time probably 10 mins
Leo Ludlow"
"Mostly hexagon shapes in various colours. Starting and ending in bright orange. I found after a while I could change the shapes from hexagon to circles to squares with my mind. I could also change the direction of travel from tunnels to sideways travel, to star bursts.
 I couldn’t change the colours, just shapes and directions. I had an astral travel experience via meditation once, it reminded me of that. It’s amazing what your mind can do.
 (I have a slight headache now though)
Amazing experience!!!"
"The light changed between seeing both light and uplifting and heavy and compressing.
It felt very intense, as everything was closing in from around and reaching a boiling point. At these stages I felt very uncomfortable and a little frightened. 
I had no idea how long the experience lasted, but found myself drifting between imagination and visual stimulation, sometimes unsure which was which.

As well as the intense flash, I was amazed how heavy the darkness felt and how black it could get. We were gently lifted out of this with the soft glow and peaceful music, but I am unsure how I would feel if this pace would change rapidly. 
The intensity of this project was amazing."
"At the very end it felt like a resolution as if the whole world and myself were one with purpose
Thought I saw an amazing array of patterns and colours
The sound was superb - both engaging and relaxing. It changed my visuals as the sounds changed. 
The type and variety and position of the flickering lights changed the colours and patterns of my visuals. 
When it was dark it felt heavier "
"Unique and amazing experience. 
Colours shape and sounds, squares stimulation leading to peace and calmness. The music was so atmospheric and enjoyable complimenting the experience. 
So many different shapes and figures like holographs. Building assemble and the assemble"
"When red predominant did not enjoy but enjoyed the lilac, purple green and navy spirals and curved shapes. 
I found it mainly relaxing but the red seemed to unsettle. 
The music and breathing were enjoyable can many of the shapes swirling were calming, spoiled by the red for me."
"At first it felt like the whole room was spinning, it took a while until I grounded myself by taking a few deep breaths. The first image I could see was the outline of a baby in the yellow/red light. Almost like I was looking at a womb. I felt very emotional as I almost has a connection to it. Then I was launched into a flashing white atmosphere. It reminded me of thunder and lightning, then city lights. I later found myself in a brighter light which felt like mountains and snow. Constantly facing the different seasons and feeling exposed to nature. It felt like a safe space. Then I could see a burning sphere, it made me think of how the earth is burning and how nature has responded to us destroying it. Then after more purple, green"
"I could see a recurring spinning set of clots in the middle and spacing out. Bright neon colours appeared a few times in a sequence in circles and in squares equally spaced out. At times when the lights and music calmed, I could see a light orange colour getting lighter and lighter which was moving like static. I could see a dark blue colour with geometric shapes moving apart. 
When the music intensified, the stars and shapes were moving faster, spinning, shapes changing from different geometric designs. 
When the music changed to a moving helicopter sounds, I could see the propellers moving - it looked like and felt like I was being lifted into the sky. At the end the colours got lighter as the music calmed and I was being lifted higher. The colours were solid blue/white/yellow - changing between the 3 ."
"It was mainly a changing landscape of geometric patterns and colours, usually with something standing out in the center far away. This central image was usually a white figure that looked like a person wearing white and I kept wondering if my eyes were slightly open and what I was seeing was the person across from me. 
I often saw my own hands folded in front of me but did not feel that my eyes were open at all"
"Very hard to explain specifically what I saw…
There were a lot of tunnels wearing into each other, turning into one huge kaleidoscope. Every time I closed my eyes harder, this again radically changed my visuals. I have left with a feeling of serenity, this was a genuinely beautiful experience. Thank you for giving me the opportunity. 
Also,Jon Hopkins was the perfect candidate to soundtrack the experience. "
"I mostly saw real things. I picture my family. I saw “winter”, which is a 6-year-old labrador (dog) that I recently met. I saw myself wandering in nature and in the mountains, where I felt most happy. I don’t think I was out of my body. It seems like when you are between awake and sleep, when you are still connected to outside sounds and colours but your mind wanders through different experiences. 
Perhaps there’s some connection between what we experienced in the past and the sounds /colors you listen/see."
"Feeling of motion, moving through a tunnel, constant moving forwards. Some visions - family, an ostrich! Changing from dark to light, pink blobs featured as an eye, pink then white / lilac, Lilac spots or white, black dust? moving around like a TV channel of snow! Saw a sunset sky, clouds and colours. My head did hurt a bit but it was relaxing. I felt myself drifting into a dream at the end, saw an old house with a beekeeper. It felt like stepping inside the consciousness and experiencing it as a flow, a constant changing picture of colour and image felt very relaxed after. The more I concentrated on my breath. The more vivid things were, more movement etc.
Felt happy, calm, and at peace. Felt the tangible sense that “life” and conscious life is a journey moving forwards in constant motion, ever changing, but rich and beautiful, if you choose to see it. "
"I felt like I was in a dream, floating through space and time. Isaw lots of reds, oranges, yellows and a blue night sky with white stars. Near the beginning of the experience I went through a spinning circular tunnel of red circles and blue waves. I saw a lot of waves of red light and an intense moment when I saw lots of oval shapes of yellow light surrounded by bright orange light and that was surrounded by bright red lights. Near the end of the experience I saw something that resembled a static TV screen. "
"The experience was simultaneously visceral, emotions and intellectually expansive. At times this was liberating and almost felt like a given adrenaline but at others it became quite intrusive and heightening. The experience going into the church in the middle of a and run down 
I felt that I had never been on a wet blustery Saturday afternoon. It was one the most positive parts of the experience. It’s wonderful to see the sunflowers, the scientist and young people came into the heart of Belfast - a truly mind opening experience just for me but for Belfast. 
Thank you 
"
"Bright checkboards like flying VCR tape green-red blue-yellow light flowing and black orbs, speedy forward then diagonally. Darkness then bright dawn, gentle, obliterating, then the shapes again. Lost track of time. No body, no shapes, no signs or forms, just colour and movement. A glimpse of speeding trees? At the end an eye, like this, like Balor. It opens and burns away the rest, it closes on darkness but slowly a yellow sky returns."
"Beautiful spirals of colour which blended to create a vortex that continued to guide me through twists and turns.  Some were permeated by blusts of star-like spin which appear to have words and turns which I couldn’t quite make out. Occasionally I could see human-like figures mainly in the past, followed by images of the earth spinning. I then went through memories of my wife, my brother while we were young. I was flooded with memories of yellow, grey from silly patterns to layers and giggles. This was never at the front of my mind, recently so I was happy I had three months to process and that this went on."
"Kaleidoscopic blues, purples, oranges, quite overwhelming at times. I didn’t see anything that was solid or seemed “real”, but I had the impression that there was something larger and more complex happening behind the kaleidoscope. That I couldn’t quite resolve. Intense and maybe a little sinister!
I got distracted by the music eventually - the effect of the low frequencies at the loudest parts - vibrations ribs - was really pleasant. "
"Initially it seemed that a person to my left was being escalated away. Then dozens of people (one at a time) sat down either side of me (noticeable within my peripheral vision - it seemed). Then my hand pose (clasped hand on my chest) was guided to my right but in a striking red. Then more people sat down either side of me. The people tried to sit into each other similar to a Russian doll effect, the person shrinking as they sat. 
It seemed to be a man of a heroic army  to my right and a bearded viking man initially to my left replaced by a fisherwoman. Ahead of me a woman was sat down, plaited hair, reading a book."
"Sometimes it was like a static television channel that would travel me to different spaces through circular time warps that were full of colour. 
I was touched by a darker moment with a purple piece of land that had a hole in it, and this hole crumbled to get bigger and bigger. Until the purple land was gone.
At one point I saw a face, maybe my face, in bright yellow and red and I went inside my face. Traveled into it, into my molecules, my pores, my everything.
I looked at the galaxy from afar.
I basked in the sun.
I cried a single tear of euphoria (?) nostalgia (?) sadness? 
It was an experience I didn’t want to end. 
But Ishould add I saw an explosion of colour that seemed like the end of something - a place, a thought , an existence. 
It was moving, literally and figuratively. "
"When I first started the experience I didn’t know what to expect. When I closed my eyes I felt relaxed and excited. I first saw the sun rising above the horizon on what looked like a savannah. The light quickly turned to a myriad of patterns, some hexagonal, some rhombus, all different shapes and colours. I saw stars, both like this, and like this ::: My favorite part was when I felt like I was what looked like an ancient nation with symmetrical pillars, and I felt like I was falling through an ancient Grecian Palace. I saw windows from floor to ceiling and white pillars. Another favorite was the little pink elephants
I saw walking in hexagonal shapes 🙂I felt quite amazed at what my brain can do and I really enjoyed my experience.
"
"Lines/ geometric shapes / numbers /colours
An explosion of chaos and colour
Like a mix of Star Trek meets Dr. Who timelapse.
Very linear patterns
A sense of the Ocean
Mostly red specially at the start but this changed as the experience passed with more yellows, oranges , blues and greens.
Hitting  warp speed  just about sum it up
Felt my eyes moving a bit, almost uncomfortably 
I also felt like I was  forgetting to breathe and had to consciously take a breath!"
"The flashing initially felt uncomfortable, and I found myself deliberately trying to distract myself with thoughts about work and other memories of today. Once I allowed myself to feel safe in the discomfort I began to notice shapes - leaves, trees? Forest vibes. At one point I saw a figure with a backpack walking away from me. I also, very strangely, saw a man resembling Henry Hill at one stage. Briefly, but he was there… The dark thick glasses were the main notable feature. Sunlight and warmth (tangible warmth) felt in the beginning and ending. I also at some stages forgot to breathe - perhaps a sign of when I was most “in” the experience. The most calm I felt was when a pattern of green dots appeared"
"I saw endless corridors, lined with shamrocks that pulsed and spinned with purple light. 
I saw shapes morph into things but centred around a cross, and they took the forms of a spinning sea God who was on top of the waves. I couldn’t feel my arms and felt like I was in sleep paralysis but it wasn’t unpleasant. I saw like newspaper paint and felt I was watching headlines of events and in the background I felt those events."
"I felt like I was in a magical fairground. It was like LA in a kaleidoscope. I felt multiple levels and swirling lights entering clockwise and anticlockwise. I felt like I was in space, floating and swimming in a sea of lights and colors. I thought the person next to me was singing and chanting. At one point it was a huge humm.
It was a very intense experience, similar to when I took LSD in my youth. It felt like a magic fairground ride, I was in my own video game"
"Very hard to explain specifically what I saw… There were a lot of tunnels weaving into each other, turning into one huge kaleidoscope. Every time I closed my eyes harder, this again radically changed my visuals. I have left with a feeling of serenity, this was a genuinely beautiful experience. Thank you for giving the opportunity. 
Also, Jon Hopkins was the perfect candidate to soundtrack the experience."
"For me my kind of meditation needs the seat to be straight. I found the position I was lying in very uncomfortable. I found the music heavy, soulless, and oppressive. My only thought was - should I stay to the end or shall I leave? A few moments longer and I would have left. It made me feel intolerant, frickly, aggressive. "
"The experience was very relaxing with moments of high intensity. I felt connected and the emerging bright lights at the start sensing the presence of God. As the lights and noise continued my mind wandered to various places. Relaxation and the anxiety and the lights and shapes matched that of the feelings. When there was anxiety, the shapes were sharpened and were defined and as the mind relaxed the shapes and colours softened. 
Very mindful exercise and nice to experience complete relaxation in my whole body as I left.
Thank you"
"I felt very relaxed and aware of a changing sense of inner space, particularly, I think, under blue. I felt on the brink of outer space on several occasions, including a sense of traveling in space for a few memorable moments.
Occasionally, I felt I was inside or part of a lava lamp but we were also inside little circles I was aware of little additional apart from the light and sounds. I meditate a lot and wondered whether my habit or innerlight prevented greater stimuli from occurring "
"My second visit - very different. The first time was almost visually overwhelming, music and colours synchronizing in the form of geometric shapes with hard edges. This time was more spherical, orb-like shapes, less intense, only occasionally breaking into high contrast geometric shapes. 
The sense of contrast movement - changing, convoluted - sometimes like vast spaceships rearranging their shapes. The same sense of having a panoramic screen in new- space. just beyond reach. I used to feel this way, of the space as a screen when eyes closed much more as a child.
I want to keep coming back to this - like being a psychonaut, a traveler in inner space (cheese-sounding, I know! )"
"I saw white and red squares making a path that would go back, right or oblique. Then the squares became more visible, they had wrinkles on them. 
After I just saw the desert, it was all sand-colour . I felt like a dead Egyptian. I was flowing somewhere. Then I fell asleep."
"A central revolving spiral composed of leaf-like scales shimmering in radiant colours of the rainbow. In every single scale the rainbow colours were breaking just like in clouds in the sky - moving and changing in speed  and size with the music playing, breathing, pulling me closer in and pushing me further out. Intensifying with increasing relaxation. Flying. 
At this point I lost any sense of my body. I’m flying through a wormhole of in themselves revolving spirals, faster and faster, feeling lighter with every second."
"Shifting multi-coloured shapes. Very geometric often. Something shapes (like needles), some blockier (like hexagons) Colours changed from white, to grey blue, greens, oranges, violets, dark purples, to black. A very pleasant and restful experience. I thought, thought, I was expecting a more profound experience. Thoroughly enjoy it all. "
"There’s someone hiding behind the colours
I see the birth of the universe twice
Then think of my egg and bacon bun
and how its sitting in my tummy
I see the unseen and the whole world calmly collides and the I worry that my crush hasn’t answered my text
I feel peace and fear in the same breath
Did I turn off the light  when I left home? does god exist, is it him behind the colours? Should I have trained to be an astronaut? How small, how big the world is
my feet are cold, my heart is open, I flew through space twice, for lunch I think I want rice."


"

Euphoria. Peace. Everything I was part of all at once, time & space went through me and i was there for it all. 
The patterns began to move with the music and my breath. 
"
"I liked especially how sounds resembled so many things on the nature. I was reminded of the rhythms of th sea tides, the endless span of mountains back in my hometown, the glorious glow of sunrise and rainbows I saw at the top of the mountain and the heat and power and _________ of the great sun. In the background there’s a sound reminding me of the language of bees, which I heard when visiting the Royal Botonic Garden. And I fancy how the last section, the peaceful and deep one. Was relatable to my experiences of meditating in temples in the southern part of China, in which the ultimate peace and stillness and emptiness settled on my heart. Yet empowring it at the same time. "
"There was consistently a circle in the middle, it would change colour /size/ intensity but it was always there. At the very end it turned into an eye. 

As a mediator it felt like I had control more, I felt like I was manipulating my consciousness; when my mind got distracted the shapes/colours were less clear… when I refocused everything became more refined + detailed. 
"
"I saw patterns which I believe were the result of the light playing on the capillaries etc of my eyes.
Quire relaxed afterwards.
Contempt for all the bullshit of other people’s descriptions. It’s all ‘mindfullness’ expecation. Perception still corrupted by language, innit. “Look at me, I understood imperemnce, I was so interconnected,” yeah you’re fucking Buddha now.

Chunks of energy, layers of it.

"Wow! And intense vibrant massive colours common shapes, is patterns morphing in changing in my head. A real kaleidoscope of geometric patterns. A scene of bright colours. This is my second time and it was more visual and more dynamic them before. I felt totally relaxed and zoned out. The range of colours I saw/imagined covered the spectrum-the most common I remember why combinations of red and green. Remember ring the detail behind the experience is difficult – rather like a dream but what a dream. Thank you!"
"I felt at times like I was floating through space in a whirlwind. I felt like I was inside a kaleidoscope, with a lot of regular patterns and shapes. I felt like the music and visuals carried me off into another world, with lots of colour. I felt at the beginning like I was lying on the beach on holiday-with bright light I always felt warm and fuzzy. I felt sometimes like I was going through a tunnel and then other times I feel like I was running around. I felt like I want to experience it again and like I could stay in there all day!"
"Like I began to rise up from deep within a red Sea, which group brighter as I came nearest to the surface of the water. When I imagine I saw bright orange sand dune. At the top of the universe bright white light. They’re  we’re burst of other images throughout – pulses of red and green tangling together forming towers, Road and even butterflies. At other times it felt like I was moving fast through space, flying past the perimeter of planets. Throughout, though, I kept returning to the bright dune. Towards the end, it felt like night was coming and the dunes became dark blue. At this point I felt like I was descending back into the sea emerged from, which faded from dark blue to black."
"Control over rotation of the lights. When the kaleidoscope shape started to appear, spinning your eyes caused the shapes to rotate, even after your eyes stop moving. Different vertical eye positions would emphasise different shapes and colours. Focusing on the centre was fun. Cool shapes to come flying toward you and like leaning your eyes would avoid collision. Similar to sailing through space and dodging asteroids. Lots of accidents and spirals appeared. Many of these shapes in multiple combinations. Spinning and pulsating. Light was warm and still at times red was very prominent colour."
"First I felt like I was trying to control it too much. I struggle to handle the intensity. But then, I started to let go and so kaleidoscope type patterns, moving so fast in the most amazing colours, I saw the Sun – up close. It’s all like dancing on water and what look like cells, cells from an organism. The speed at which it changed was amazing. When I looked away, with my eyes closed I saw animals and once so my dad. Almost like drawings of animals that was intense."
"Observed very definite shapes – very sharp lines in a lot of contrast. I felt as if I was moving all the time. As the layers changed to become more brighter I was starting to think that I may have actually had my eyes open. Overall, I mostly saw moving tunnels. I hope any of this makes sense."
"Kaleidoscopic patterns of vivid colours flying through the milky way, stars zooming nearer and further away intense calm and oneness with the universe.
Calmness in the face of deth + dying
Sand dunes and forests 
In a forest flade with trees spinning in a car with eyes half closed and  rain drops distorting colours and figures into blobs 
Calm 
Space 
Colour

"Intense moments of orange light - warmth towards head
Enveloping cloud shapes - Mushroom clouds
Intenses washes of blue sky, clouds, water
Lights and darker tones and overlapping wave,
Sensation of underwater or staring directly up to the sky
Hexagon patterns 
Intersecting trade of light - parallel lines -

"This is my second attempt at the dream machine, this time, I saw more colours and more defined shapes than the simple cross before, in a different range of colours, more greens/purple. One again the stripey people were back, moving towards me. They just kept moving towards me and it was always in groups of two/three. Again it was like one of those moving picture tricks from the victorian age & it was in the black and white tones. "
"I felt transported somewhere for away. I saw lots of patterns to some cubic, some special and lots linear. I felt strange coming back at the end, it took me a while to feel my body again and for it to feel like mine. It made me feel peaceful.

"
I saw sand dunes robing, with sand storms being kicked up. 
I was in the ocean looking up at the sun through the water as I fell deeper, but I felt safe. I travalled at great speed through hexagonal vortexes of purple and white. 
I found myself in a vast green _____ of stars. I went through infinitely repeating doors and windows of a castle - like structure.
"
"A million beauties of the world. 
Perspective, gratefulness of what I’ve experienced so far in my life. Layers seeing through the shapes, colours + motions to find deeper hidden meaning. Searching for answers.
Control yet no control. I can conjure what I see got I love no control of the order, pattern, intensity etc.
Therapeutic would love to see more of this available to people who are struggling mentlly. This is your space and no can \------- that. The beauty is beyond imagination + to see that when all you see is grey is so important.

"I felt I saw the music playing 
I was impressed with the feeling that my consciousness was faced to “play” with the music.
The description of dance “as music we can see” come to me
The description of dnce “as music we can see” come to me
Sometimes when I meditate I can see the tunnels that I travel through in this dreammachine 
The tunnels seemed to come to life. Usually they are dark in appearance, with no colour or texture or life force. There these tunnels danced and twirled and appeared in beautiful shimmering colours. 
Beauty in motion 
"
"It felt relaxing, loved the music. At the start I felt like I was fighting my eyes to close but when they finally did I saw circles of colour swallowing themselves, the main colours being a vibrant pink, with yellow. Inside was an electric blue. When the music got more intense, the blue followed. Loved this experience so much. "
"A variety of feelings/senses. Like a journey of senses really. The light wasn’t so much an image as a feeling. There were patterns, and swells of light. 
The warm light felt warm, sunny. And I smiled. The strobe +  ________ light almost tickled the back of my mind. I felt different parts of my brain stimulated. There was a sense of joy. And almost the meditative access.

Shades of blue I haven’t seen before, sunrises from very high up (like from the top of a mountain) - seeing the light _____ - a lot of blue, red, orange, lilac at the end, what look like black holes, & galaxies concrete cycles moving

"
I felt anxious, like I didn’t know it I should continue very intene colours, extremely vivid colours. I actually felt emotional almost upset at one point seen what I can only really describe as fractal patterns. One big constant I saw, was a glowing orb that shifted colours and followed my eyes whereve I moved them in my head. It would come and go but what constant 
"
"Euphoric, relaxing, I felt like shapes (like the outline of people) were passing past my periphery vision half moons. Colours were mostly oranges, blues, and red. 
I thought initially I might feel more uncomfortable but instead felt extremely relaxed. Real life kaleidoscope. Thank you. I haven’t breathed a slowly and smoothly in quite a while. 
"
"Seen all sorts of colours, shapes, movement transitioning while I assume the level of light was variating. Thought very little altogether. 
Felt delighted the whole way through. Had to double check my eyes were closed as the colours were so vivid. 
"
"
Trippy!! I found the circular light. There was a doot way in theback impossible to get to, stars, swirls, kaleidoscope popping in and out but whats at the door what was behind it. I tried to focus real hard but could reach it then it disappears and all the coloured light circles! Super fun & insightful in a way I can’t explain. I have ADHD started hard to quiet the mind but by the end it was focused & trying to keep it focused. 
"
"Lots of symmetrical patterns, often flower shapes + circles, sometimes with black lighting flashes some of the colours (orange/yellow) just felt a sense of wamrth. Like the sun on a sunning day (Just like today) 
Sometimes it was as if there was a semi-circle of whiteness (thought with a yellow/green tinge) emerging from the bottom of my vision uo. 
Colours that appeared together were the purple + lime green. 
"
"Too many colors, too fast passing everywhere that was scary at the beginning. 
I couldn’t relax myself to havemy heart less exited. 
After few minutes I could start to feel more relax and enjoy the snakes shapes that appear all the time.
The colour blye and red were predominant all the time with whites and yellow very electric colours and the feeling was that everything was too fast. 
"
"Underwater - the sea - but tranquil, floating, dappled overlight, at peace, not drowning but extremly calm. 

Like a journey and then the music changed and sounded like something had broken down - clear image of cell - like _______ in a spiral pulsating getting tighter in the middle. Red in the background. 
Then music become more light + felt like new day, in a meadow with flowers over me, couldn’t see the sun but could feel the warmth, the light. 
"
"Pulsing lights, changing colours, vivid blues, red, yellows, purple, black. Changing shapes, like watching something spinnng. Wow - reminded me of the search of ‘joe 90’ ___ he sits in the chair + that centrifuge things spins around him!
relaxed , almost like a sense of moment.

"Colours in blocks of squares. Upon the light extinguishing then a blue purple lightning bolt down the centre. Yellow / mellow, then red expanding dots.
River of yellow and purple flooring / _______ vision in different places and directions. 

Eventually I started visualsing someone _____
Different ways to comb my hair across my face, weird:) 
Then I remembered where I was and came back into the moment. 
It was a fascinating experience and over way too quickly.   
"
Swirling specks which changed intensity. Almost like water ripples. Because of my astigmatism at times colours would come in & out of focus of there would be breaks of colour where my “eye floaters” usually would be an endless void with some hints of colours. 
"I was schooked and jumped when Ann came back in and spoke. I am not sure I was asleep but I was definitely elsewhere. But I can’t describe the place of space I was at the time and spoke. When I first felt myself rifting away, I was conscious of moving through lead litter in a garden. Moving around and exploring through plants and organic matter. Almost as if I was a worm it seemed I came to water that I couldn’t cross. Then I was concentrating on the music. Flowing th music without being anywhere of conscious of anything. "
"Movement, shapes, forms, blips of colour moving fast and slow. Entities of different natures gliding between each other. The shapes all behaved different and came with their own unique energy like chapters in a book or scenes in a movie. It mimicked the music. It was beautiful. "
"It was just fantastic to be able to see so many fractals and perfect symmetry. 
I speak spanish so this might be the wrong spelling. 
It felt happiness when  the yellow and white light took over all the space, it made me smile. So many beautiful colours!!!

I also felt that maths are the most perfect “things” in the world and that, because of that, God is maths. 
What an amazing, once in a lifetime experience! Thank yoy so much! :) 
"
"I saw a lot of shapes and colour. Mostly round, but sometimes squares, too. The shapes appeared mostly in, red, yellow, orange, pink, but also blye and green in front of balck background. The background sometime switched abruptly from black to white, yellow, or blue. 

It was like looking though a kaleidoscope with a lot of movement involved. The changed with the music too. At some point the music sounded like a train moving through a tunnel and I could see the shape of a train coming toward me. 
"
"
I saw a lot of geometric shapes, in the beginning they were a bit like mandalas (the colouring pattern)
All sorts of shapes
Dominance of reds and blues 
Sinding bowls
At the end, I felt like I was in water, it was like a green ocean. 
It was amazing! 
[Took a break!]
It is actually difficult to put the experience into words. I gave up on the drawing nearly as soon as everyone sat down around the table!
I felt transported into space, a very calm and soothing outer space.
It was amazing to be able to see with my eyes closed.
I wanted to cheat and open my eye s but didn’t as I know it wouldn’t be as amazing. The combination of lights & sounds were magical it was like being in a tense (trance?)
I’ll never forgot today, thank you for a spectacular experience! Helene from Paris

Lots of symmetrical patterns, often flower shapes + circles, sometimes with black lightning flashes for some of the colours (orange/yellow) just felt a sense of warmth, like the sun on a sunny day (just like today)
Sometimes it was as if there was a semicircle of whiteness (though with a yellow/green tinge) emerging from the bottom of my vision up. Colours that appeared together were the purple + lime green.  
"
"
It started off quite a gently, with large expanses of yellow getting brighter and more intense - I felt like I was in a really hot, vast area - like a park that has experienced a fraughtht or a plain. Then, when the lights started flashing I saw star-like clusters of blue and sometimes expanses of blue. Soon it become too intense and I felt uncomfortable and worried that it would harm me / my heart a I wanted to continue but felt I couldn’t so I left. 
"
"
I saw vibrations, as though watching rain fall onto a pane of glass.
I saw kaleidoscope patterns when morphed and danced, lots of symmetry of patterns. 
I thought about where I parked my van, what I would make from dinner tomorrow, that I was experience a trip.
I felt a deep sense of calm and grounding. Peace I felt very relaxed whilst also chaned with energy. 
"
"It was a bit overwhelming at first, until I get used to the brightness But after a while it felt quite safe the light was warm and the music was soothing. I saw mostly geometric patterns with an overall red colour theme. I saw the some patterns repeatedly which I didn't expect - hexagons, arches and little bubbles
I thought a lot about the other people and wondered what they were seeing at the exact moment I was seeing and how wonderful it is to have the ‘same’ bodies but not the same experience. It reminds you that we all might be similar but our perspectives are wildly different.
"
"I saw slowly changing colours & shapes, some blurred moving slowly then changing form & moving very quickly, all shapes moved around in circles. There were patches of squares, hexagons & triangles, connected by light and differing colours. At times I saw what looked like close up images of the sun with (……..), flares & glowing intense lights which then faded and changed form. I saw rapidly spinning spheres with lights (like comets or neutron stars. I felt I was being shown stars up close & galaxies moving extremely quickly, I also saw blocks which looked like incomplete ‘building’, or walls, they were in one side of my vision. These shapes often changed into triangles moving extremely quickly & often changed into like a ‘pond’ of different colours, as if there was different coloured dye being disturbed by an object. I felt really curious as to what each shape was doing & what was next. I thought ‘this is so interesting’ & ‘exciting’ and how hard it would be to design the experience! My thoughts returned to enjoying the colours & shapes. I thought also this might be an extreme version of being a baby or very young and trying to understand what I saw. "
"I felt very relaxed during the whole experience. Like when you are tired and decide to watch a movie comfortable sitting on your sofa, during the whole
I was thinking that I could definitely do this every day instead of watching TV. There were so many things that I could see with eyes closed and resting. So many colours and shapes dancing around me. When it finished I felt so relaxed and ready to start the day... similar effect that I get after meditation but this doesn't need practice or any particular mindset. I loved it.
"
"It started out as very much just a collection of lights, colours and patterns. But as the experience went on it because similar to the chaotic feeling of falling asleep, various personal thoughts and feelings surface alongside insecurities I have about my relationships. I definitely felt myself falling asleep at several points, but the machine brought me back, and so the cycle would start again, but with different patterns turning into new images. 
Towards the end I remember the patterns turning into the visual of me under water, crystal clear, as I moved towards the surface and broke it, the scene transformed into a brightly lit sandstone cave and the water became a shallow stream running through it only to disappear moments later. So yeah, definitely a dream like experience."
"Mosaic of geometric colours, flashing, moving, sometimes lines of lights like rain moving fast during & colour. Sometimes colour just colour was an eye shape, never anything natural or uneven, almost more like machine like changing from big bounds of colours, blues, oranges, reds & greens fracturing into (.......?). Never really like a sky or natural lights & often with a mad mix mix of ever changing colours."
"The song sets as a precursor for our dream. Organic circuitry shuts down, systems repair as they please. The sun rises and the circuitry awakens again, then shuts off again, awakens again as the sun continues to speed through the sky. Days whizz past in an instant and one experiences time as the mountains and rivers do. The earth views time differently and with indifference. We are, and always have been, at one with the endless cosmos. "
"Feel like swimming in open water the sea.
Felt like my horizon of visionwas consistently endless like a see the shapes for miles further than my normal field of vision.
Felt comfortable at ease seemed to take a long time to come back to myself after it all ended.
Wanted the experience not to end.
Would like to draw but don't feel capable to pay true homage to colours. "
"I saw lots of abstract shapes and colours that morphed into other shapes and colours. It reminded me of the spiro giro set my brother had when I was wee. And it reminded me of looking into a Kaleidoscope, and of a mandala and of a hand made bracelet a friend had that changed shape when you lightly pressed on it. I saw differently coloured honeycombs and the pupil of my eye grow and then fade into other scenes. At the very start I saw flames. Small light flames - that morphed into the next scene. And I fell asleep for I don't know how long and woke up knowing I'd had a really interesting, animated story but it was just out of my reach and I couldn't bring it back."
"Amazing bright colours - bright lights, oranges, electric blue! 
Bright yellow like the sun coming up in the desert - could feel the warmth from the sun. When there were lots of colours floating, felt like the chaos of walking through the road in Marrakech. Overall feeling of warmth, calm, wellbeing. 
Best light show of any major concert or anything I have ever seen. "



"Felt very secure. relaxed. moments of elations.
So many colurs and energy.
The main music seemed to enhance the experience. 
Not sure how much time passed. 
Very restful and relaxed. never taken a “trip” but it was like looking through a kaleidoscope so much color.
Did not want it to end. Would love to rest here for an hour or longer. The music felt it was driving me like a hug. 
Beautiful and very enlightening :)"
"octagonal structures appearing peripheral vision then quite precise
edges to these shapes but they vanished, making way for more “lava lamp” type visions, and distant landscapes. Large perspectives framed by crazy cliff-like edges that were of people in these landscapes and I’d realized it wasn’t a circular shape I’d imagined but the space we were in."
"I felt I was constantly traveling through a space tunnel like vectors at points there felt like there were blue particles appearing and my face. the light was warmth. I just constantly felt in a floe, but still. I don’t know why but it reminded me of crime… and brought me back to when I was a teen watching crime films on Chanel 4 at midnight. 
Towards the end I felt like my imagination was getting as films as I saw people but their outline was near and (like the glow sticks) I was relaxed and could have stayed for days as it was very comfortable and I felt quite at peace. "
"Geometrical shapes, moving/vibrating all colours merging, like a kaleidoscope 
I saw pronunciations in the centre of my field of vision, a yellow cross, into a union jack style sixe lines “concentric circles aligned” like a symbol.
I meditated/stretched, many thoughts of coming work, etc - problem solving solutions. Enjoyed being in the moment
Felt calm, allowed my mind to wander.
Differently, I imagined myself in a European world's fair, turn of last century! :) "
"I seen fractalized light pulsating similar to a flow or water colours pulsated between red, black, blue, yellow and green.
Within the experience I saw a “shadow” man silhouette . Showed its shape in a dark purple with a singular intense orange light. Coming from the centre of its head. Great experience, no that was felt from the shadow man. Extremely relaxing, I would do it again."
"At the start , the really bright orange light was hard to “see” but as it went on it got easier / my eyes got used to it. I felt some full body “vibrations” through the music and light. I sar mainly abstract shapes throughout but some of them mixed with my memories or thoughts like that of a man in a green suit on a beach with the pattern in front of him obscuring the view of him. 
Towards the end, I felt like I was drifting off into sleep. "
"In the beginning a soft glow of pink came into my vision and I felt safe. I imagined myself as a baby in the womb and how calming it was. As the experience prograssed, my visions became more intense and vibrant. Swirls of colours bursting across my mind. I felt as though I was zooming through the universe but at the same time it felt so peaceful. I was moving towards a point of rainbow colours before it would disappear and new patterns and colours would  replace it. I felt fluid, happy to move with the pace and patterns. I feel different coming out of the experience, a new yet familiar feeling of understanding 
Thank you :)"
"Calm and safe, cocooned, womb-like. At points it got intense and at some point felt a little frightening but mostly my own mindset was relaxed and calm. The only mental image I had was of my brother and his wife's wedding picture which I was looking at today as it was their anniversary. He died last October so this has been a day to think about  him a little. I thought at one point I saw flowers and colours but really not completely in focus. 
I could have stayed in it a lot longer, and would have been happy there all night! 
It felt weightless, maybe like floating in space or underwater.  "
"Amazing bright colours- bright light orange electric blue! 
Bright yellow like the sun coming up in the desert - could feel the warmth from the sun. 
When there were lots of colours flashing it felt like the chaos of walking through the souks of Marrakech .
Overall feeling of warmth, calm, well-being.
Best light show then any major concert or anything I have ever seen
Calm"
"I saw lots of abstract shapes and colours that morphed into other shapes and colours. It reminded me of the spiro giro set my brother had when I was little.
And it reminded me of looking into a kaleidoscope, and of a mandala and of a handmade bracelet a friend had that changes shape when you lightly press on it. I saw different coloured honeycombs and the pupil of my eye grow and then fade into other scenes. At the very start I saw flames - small, light flames - that morphed into the next scene. And I fell asleep for I don’t know how long - and woke up knowing I’d had a really interesting, animated story but it was just out of my reach and I couldn’t bring it back ."
"The story light was totally soothing and calming like the meaning of the world OBVIO in all its meaning. I saw this well, those shapes/iding fast like passing roller coaster 
I was flying above purple smooth mountains for a short time- 
Sometimes forgetting to breathe and having to remain out of it
Some sequence were really working for me but where too short to really feel the benefit of it
Like a teaser of something I would like to try more often"
"Futuristic landscapes. 
feeling of space and time. 
kaleidoscope of colours and shapes.
Feeling of warmth with bright colours and then deep and dark colours. 
very soothing music."
"Assorted bright colours of red, green, blue, violet, lines of green and yellow. Star field view experience pulses of colours emitting from a centre point outwards, checkered shapes flowing and oscillating. Being conscious of the music and having the same feeling when exposed to bright Sunlight at times. The colours and patterns experienced not unlike on 8 bit computer graphics demo like on Atari  800 or Commodore 64. Abstract patterns mostly and fear if any actual shapes dissemble as actual things in reality. Felt like a good R.E.M sleep afterwards."
Lots of colors & different Shapes Always with a purple centre. edges blurred & different shapes emerging. Very much like a Kaleidoscope. Changed with the intensity of the music. sense of Sunrise & sunset.

Most of the time the central vision was a Kaleidoscope of colours in direction moving in and out. Towards the end I lost a sense of time as I seemed to be floating. 
I saw lots of changing and mutating shapes and colours. It all looked very cosmic and space like. I felt like I was floating in outer space. At times the light + shapes was dot like + flashed and at times it was like I just saw a sheet or block of colour and no shapes. It also felt like looking through a kaleidoscope.  
"I saw different colours there, first red and light greens mostly. I kept seeing flowers over and over again and hearing the sound of planes and the ocean. It felt like a very safe space. "

As lights changed there seemed to be depth.

"High Sensory Experience. Multiple colours and shapes all about.  When the light appeared bright, it had a definite yellow tinge, almost like lying on a sunlit beach. Often the rapid pulsing would produce red colours throughout my field of view, with geometric circles in my peripheral. 
When the pulsing slowed, I would be left with mottled lilac/lavender dots arranged in columns.
I found the High Sensory Experience more interesting, but the Deep Listening Experience more enjoyable.

"Like moving down a very brightly lit tunnel towards a patch of darkness. With spiraling stars and patterns like herringlone. I felt very disconnected from my body, it took a while before I could move my limbs after the experience.Disco ball/diamonds Kaleidoscope Spins, swirls, lights & stars/galaxy like"
"When lights were off - had showers of blue stars.
Loads of multicolour fractals.
Visuals became more intense as the intensity of music increased
Music perfect accompaniment. 
Colours - golden, red, blue, green. 
Red tunnels - white light at end of it

"At first the flashing lights were frustrating but as time went on they became more relaxing. 
The bright light was like opening everything up and the sun/sunset/flowers and nature.
No thoughts flashing through my mind as the want on just lots of colours or sense of
drifting off. More aware of the vibrations from the sound & half focusing on the colours or that this is what my brain is setting a scene.

"I seen a lot of light. Blue and red flashing lights with white symbols flashing

Bright lights flashing before my eyes in a range of colours. 
"To begin with there was geometrical shapes and colour. Then almost bursting through were bright orange and white clouds. And there a gap in the clouds and the sky beyond was safe and real and warm. Then there were moments of what looked like electricity cutting down through the picture. 
It sounds ridiculous but there were moments when I thought I could see people who I’ve not seen in a long time. Some paused on, it changed constantly.

"AT THE START OF THE EXPERIENCE I FELT LIKE IT WAS QUITE CELESTIAL OR LIKE BATHING IN THE MORNING SUN. AT TIMES I FELT LIKE I WAS TRAVELLING AT HYPERSPEED, ALMOST THROUGH A BRIGHTLY COLOURED TUNNEL SURROUNDED BY REPEATING PATTERNS. I FELT LIKE I WAS TRAVELLING TO A CENTRAL POINT BUT NEVER GOT ANYWHERE. OTHER TIMES IN DIFFERENT
COLOURED SPACES, IT FELT LIKE MY SURROUNDINGS WHERE SPINNING OTHER TIMES WHEN THE LIGHTS STOPPED I ENTERED A BLACK SPACE WITH PURPLE PATTERNS. I FOUND BY CLOSING MY EYES TIGHTER I COULD CHANGE THE COLOURS. AT TIMES MY EYES WOULD GRADUALLY OPEN AND THE LIGHT WOULD COME THROUGH AND DISRUPT THE EXPERIENCE.
"
"I feel intensely relaxed & peaceful. - I did fall asleep / drift 
I was floating over green space.
"
"When the lights first started getting brighter I began to see darker hues of colours, blues and reds. Once the strobe started, I saw a variety of crazy patterns. The patterns seemed to go with the music. A lot of tunnels made of Geometric shapes. When the bass increased in the music, I saw waves travelling upwards through the shapes
and colours. I don't think I saw the same Image twice, everytime the music changed or the strobe changed, so did what I saw. As the music faded out, so did the visuals. Incredible experience. 
Sorry for the poor handwriting. Lol.
"
"Tingles -. tingles in my hands and fingers too over as the strongest sensation in a physical way. My eyes saw a Kaleidoscope of colours, with bursts of reds and blues and yellows; some Flashes, some blobs some 'circles, some
fireworks’. Sometimes the shapes even moved from side to side.
Nothing was static. The music was a wonderful match for how the light shaped and moved. It filled the space.
I felt like I wanted to be more.
"
"Some sort of higher realm opened up above my head - It was so ulta hyper detailed. 
So crisp and sharp, crystal clear. I felt a presence there sending deep comfort, bliss.
"
"Amazing to see the different colours and shapes, given that we were informed beforehand that they were created by white light. I found it very relaxing and worked it to continue. "
"At the start it felt overwhelming, just for a few seconds. Sort of like going under water and knowing you'll be down there for a while. Soon you realise that giving yourself over to it and breathing makes everything okay. You’re in control.
For me it was a series of tunnels, high speed, like corridors to somewhere else.
Memories flooded my brain; the sea side, stain glass windows, occasionally crashing waves
"
"It was like being inside the most intense sunrise - brightening as a day dawns - engulfing my entire vision & glowing more & more brightly.
There was lots of white flashes having across in a beating motion - changing to blues, but that seemed to create ‘dreams' inside my head so I wasn't sure if I was awake or asleep. Several times I returned to my favourite sun orange / egg yolk yellow womb like.
"
My experience of the dreamachine was quite intense . The high sensory experience was quite different to the deep listening experience. The intensity of the lights made this experience feel more like a journey than the meditative experience of the deep listening session. Both Sessions were extremely enjoyable in their own ways!
"Flowing through time me It was like riding a wild horse through different setting, themes, Spaces, places. Gorg all and all,  flowing through time"
"geometric shapes, repeated, as when closing & pressing on ones eyes"
"I found the light that I saw at first very intense, so I used the eye mask for most of the experience. The light was orange. Towards the end, I removed the mask and saw blue and green lights.
I found some of the sounds very irritating, some of it sounded like hammering and some like drilling, or helicopter blades and I wanted it to stop. 
"
Lots of colors and shapes. They changed all the time. I felt my eyes can on moving. I didn’t know how long it lasted. very good would recommend to others. 
"Very intense reds and oranges, as solid colours which spread out into other shapes - then many geometric shapes tessellating and shifting shapes into a new formation. Solid reds and blues which become solar"" like central funnel which spread out into various shades, then into a tunnel which I could go into. As the music became more intense, shapes, colours, all become more Kaleidoscopic and rapid moving"
"There was always some type of movement and colour. Sometimes experiencing shapes almost like the electrons in our brain. Mostly seeing the colours red, orange and blue and even in darkness seeing grid shapes or flowy lines."
"Lots of coloured (multicoloured) squares checkerboard though sometimes just fuzzy hues. 
It was great fun but as someone who has taken LSD, Salvia, DMT, changa, mushrooms etc for 35 years on a semi-regular basis I was kinda expecting a more trippy experience and perhaps a flashback to that. I guess the closest I got was to the end of a Changa trip but nothing approaching salvia or DMT which is what I was anticipating. However, my partner, who has taken less than me historically, saw much more. On the whole though, great fun.

It was stunningly beautiful, and slightly disturbing/unsettling at the same time. 
Relaxing and awakening.

Sometimes it was like a heaven white room - lots of movie references throughout. Then an almost uncomfortably scorching summer's day. Lots of flashing Chequer board which was the background in a lot of moments. I've been having and anxieties I was thinking of before the experience. The space like journey through the universe became a journey/accompaniment to not just the anxiety but trying to understand + work through it in a dreamlike state. Some of one most striking moments were when it would fade to black and here would be just calming black and purplish static. The brighter more melody filled moments were of rotational

I had to tell myself to relax at times and found the phase at the beginning reminding me that I am in control helpful.
There were some scenes so beautiful, I wished I could show other people. 
I kept trying to put name sto things like ‘this is like fire’ ‘this is like water’ ‘this is the sky’ ‘this is like mosaic’

It started out as flashing lights but then began to delve into different shapes and designs. Several colourful patterns seemed to be developing. At one point I saw the skyline of a city towards the bottom of my eye while patterns kept developing in the sky above. It seemed like I was on top of a hill as I saw that. It felt like I drifted in and out of consciousness and for a few seconds felt like I was dreaming. The experience felt long at the beginning but then at the end felt like it ended very quickly.

Imagery charged very frequently, would have liked to hold on one to concentrate on it for longer.
felt like there was often a central origin point of the patterns, sort of like an eye in the middle. Colours and patterns totally changed with each step (guessing 20 seconds) as in there wasn't a transition, it just flipped to a new one. Each time it went dark I got a new fading image of a strong coloured pattern originating from the center which was old as the light was off. Sometimes during the normal running images they seemed to spin, sometimes it felt like I was spinning or rather my image was spinning, it never felt physical.

I imagined my goals and things I'd like to manifest for the future. The music made me feel in a meditative state - my soul felt light within my body. The changes in music created changes in my body like fuzzy vibrating feelings and very relaxed feelings.

"I saw outside space - green tall grass - bright blue sky and blinding sunlight. I felt
uplifted & joyful.
Then as if I was on a train and two passing one another windows chugging past quickly - light & dark, then light & dark quickly in time with the chugging. Excited as if something good was about to happen.

"Incredible, different psychedelic shapes while took me on a journey. Blue and light colour was a theme. shapes changed their forms from time to time.
Sometimes make it smaller or larger. Awesome experience.
"
"Changing lights & shapes. Space visions, bright stars
a very small wormhole. A small object falling into it. Enjoyed the warm star lights. Less so the flickering, pulsating lights - not uncomfortable though! Basically drifted off into a sleepy dream where people & events of my own life entered. Random passing events, relevant to present every day thoughts.
"
"At the start I felt a bit of orange and yellow like colours, plain colourss, no shapes, the second time I felt blue like colours, with tiny geometric figures, felt like one of The pictures you see of the Janer Webb combined with the islamic geometry you see at old muslim palaces. .
But at the end it felt like something was failing, like an error or maybe more like a warning, breathing was getting hard to keep “calm"" but suddenly peace came, like a reboot or rebirth.. From normal to fear - worry state to complete calm. 
"
"First I saw just plain bright colours, mostly different shades of Orange and yellow, sometimes blue. Then the crystalline cubicle patterns started. They were always moving and there seemed to be a center. In the center there was an object. In the beginning there were different ones - symbols like a heart, a cherry or the stellar constellation the Northern Crown. Later, it was always a cross, sometimes white, sometimes red. As time went on I caught myself drifting off like in a dream. It got harder and harder to focus. One time it felt like flying rapidly through a brick tunnel or a well towards a small round orifice - the light and the end of the tunnel. It never felt scary just very interesting."
My experience involved a focal point throughout the session. Bright bold colour with purple mainly at the centre. I was able to control the movement by switching the direction moving the image up and down and spinning in the opposite directions. It was an intense experience and enjoyable. If only the images in my head could have been recorded. The experience is difficult to put into words.
"Revelation, warmth, yellow-orange-warmth like on a nice summer afternoon from time to time loss of direction but always stayed connected to body/position. Saw lots of moving structures, often squares,  grids mostly moving to the center or from centres rotationally or spiralling afterwards. After very bright parts there was a very deep purple watery/wavey section. "
"DIAMOND SHAPES RADIATING OUT FROM CENTRE, THEN BACK IN. DIFFERENT COLOURS OF RED AMBER, ORANGE.

"Like I took the ‘red pill’ for very brief moments.
Like the very start of the journey to both heaven and hell! 
"
"Very relaxing, peaceful.
Beautiful, changing patterns of light.
Sometimes total vision filled with single colour, multiple tones some radiating patterns of spots, grids, rainbows spinning and rotating.
Like images I have previously experienced meditating. Or drifting on and out of space. Varying tempo, intensity, of images following the music.  
"
"An explosion of colour.  
Pattern's exploding, moving in circles, moving along a conveyor belt. 
Eyes with red pupils flashing - I wasn't exactly comfortable but I wasn't uncomfortable. It was a sensation I had never experienced before, like a kaledioscope behind my eyes.

"Central spot - geometric shapes shooting from centre, getting progressively larger then swirling – getting faster and tilting."

Listening to a full vinyl LP by Brian [……]
Calm and quiet. 
Very calming. I found it difficult to stop my mind running but as the music got louder I was able to relax and enjoy the moments. I could see shades of colour and flashes of light. lots of wavy lines and movement of shape.
"Really vibrant colours geometric shapes. Music changed to helicopter noise and colours toned down to more grey colours and shapes changed. Felt warm, thought patterns would make really beautiful fabric.
Relaxed, warm, beautiful colours.

"I realise I don't like flashing lights, my heart rate increased during those pieces of flashing so I put my mask down. When the flashing slowed I could lift my mask again and feel I was basking in sunlight. My sister and I had a very different experience. She is totally relaxed and wants one for home. It crossed my mind of brainwashing. Thank you for the experience :) "
"Thank you.
Are you developing an at home version of the Dreamachine experience?
"
"Spinning tunnels of spheres in a variety of colours. A iron type space with wire frame buildings, and a wireframe turtle swimming. Blue against black.
Spinning letters, words that I couldn’t read. letters illuminated like old manuscripts. looking up at faces, hazy like I was underwater and they were looking in. As time went on I saw less, I saw most at the start. 
Very relaxing.
Feeling of movement, like on the back of a bike.
"
"Started with bright orange light, transitioning a series of moving patterns. Feeling of moving, spinning, floating. 
Intense red X’s, hexagons, triangles through to floating soft linear colours of green & blue. Sensations of being among coral, floating through space. Relaxed feeling, very in the moment. Felt strange because closing eyes usually hides stimulators but it reversed it. I started daydreaming in the middle of it about life events and then came back to feeling weightless. Body felt heavy at the end.
"
"The beginning felt like dawn, day break with sun beaming on my face. Oranges and reds. Each time the light dimmed I saw particles, sometimes like a mist, other times larger. As the experience intensified I felt I was on a journey, patterns in layers - bands of lilac and mustard were a reoccurring motif. I wanted to pause what I could see and examine it further, but everything was so fleeting. Another motif was a hole in the centre, sometimes it warped and bent. Other times my field of vision was filled with an infinite red - I felt like my eyes were openat times (even though I knew they were closed). Didn’t want it to end! "
"like being inside a Kaleidoscope disco ball-spinning through space. At first block colours with a hexagon pattern - orange, then red and a deep night time blue. At the beginning it felt like I was watching the disco ball spin, by the end I was passing in and at through it. Very relaxing - didn't want it to end."
I felt like I was in outer space at the start then drifted into a near Semi-consious state.   Found some parts very intense where my rapid eye movement made me a little concerned just for a brief few Seconds. It was an amazing experience and makes you realise how wonderful we are.
"I can't believe how quickly the time went by. It felt like 10 mins max. I had moments where I was unsure my eyes were even closed. My eyes flickered a lot or at least they appeared to. I am unsure if that was just the movement of light. For the most part I was fully immersed but there were times where I felt my mind wandering and thoughts drifted to the outside world and my everyday life. I think I enjoyed the experience. I was amazed that my mind was creating what I saw. It felt like a kaleidoscope. As you turn a Kaleidescope you are unsure of what colours may appear next and it was exactly like that. When the lights were off I saw blue and black. Saw one of the most vibrant blues I ever saw. I was surprised my mind was able to produce such colours. When the lights came on from dark I saw white, then orange, yellow and red. Then it flickered to several different -colours. I remember seeing green and red a lot. The shapes I saw were irregular. No simple squares, triangles, circles. "
"I felt lost in space in the best possible way. I actually lack the vocabulary to adequately describe the visions & the accompanying feeling. Even now trying to reflect it feels like all that took place lasted an age and took place an age ago. There were intricate, colourful, rapid moving Kaleidoscope patterns - vibrant & fast but at the same time Watercolour-live & soft. In between these bursts I was bathed in what looked like a sunrise but equally could have been a light shining through the womb. I am truly in awe - fascinating experience. The only they I can compare the feeling to is a sensory deprivation - floatation bank - when l use those i feel the name ‘travelling through space/time’ effect."
"I felt warm & Relaxed inside the dreamachine. At first the low music produced soft, warm colours. When the volume increased so did the vividness of the colours The flashing lights helped produce patterns in the colours that I would find difficult to describe so I had to draw them.
Eventually it did not feel like my eyes were closed. I felt like the sun was shining on my face. The last colour I experienced was a beautiful teal/ blue.
"
"Some very vivid flashes of vibrant colours emerging & submerging & moving in sync with the music. As the sounds pulsated the images danced and exploded to reveal other images that are very difficult to describe. A very hypnotic experience that was very captivating pulling me in and away. the sights, sounds, & smells of life outsid, away from the thought and worries of life. "
"Exhausted, crazy, psychedelic, extreme colours, shapes & circles. Squares at times, frightening, not relaxing, heart racing, head space, extreme brain electrical activity. 
"
The experience of the dreamachine was very similar to states of mind I have experienced during meditation sessions albet with a deeper sense of relaxation & space than is normally experienced during normal meditation experiences. The soundtrack and overhead lights enhanced the sense of relaxation.
"At first I wanted to close my eyes - But they were already closed and could not ""protect me "" from the intrusive light. Second time around was different (main session) - when we went from bright colors to be dragged down into the dark - It felt like falling and I wanted to stay.Bright orange/yellow/red, when it filled all of my sight - It felt energising. Did have problems with “clearing” my mind. As I enjoyed both music & light, the mind still ""talked"" and interferred with an experience my body felt like doing without interruptions from a talking voice :)"
discomfort almost like going into a black hole - zooming in. Those would be the moments to ponder what is everything? What do I want? What does it mean to think? Are there innate things that are true? Are you an agent in life with the direction you choose or are there forces that shape us and our inner desires? Are our inner desires fixed or can we connect them. How do we live with feelings we don't want to have ? Are they us or are we them? l was hoping to have some answers out of that and I think in a sense I did - I answered what I want to be true - which is certainly illuminating.
"I felt my body become fully activated through my 3rd eye chakra. The Psychedelic images were coming at my 3rd eye so fast I felt my spirit begin to disconnect from my body. It frightened me! It was a very intense experience. My heart rate was highly elevated as the images came through my 3rd eye and shot down my spine. It was thrilling and overwhelming - At one point so was concerned that I was being re - programmed :O
Afterwards my entire body was vibrating and embodied.

"Enjoyed the soundtrack a lot 
nice building of layered sound across the space

Bass sounds + vibrations were good

"I felt happy when the brightest light shone like the sun warming my skin (holiday feeling)
Saw mostly Circles coming and going, and red/orange colour.
The longer the experience went on I felt myself heavier in the seat unable or want to move my head or hands.
music very calming, didn't want the experience to end!
Eyes twitching a bit towards the end. 
"
"Intense colours, full spectrum of colours.
Pulsatings Geometric Kaleidoscopic forms. Emotionally, very calm & as the colours intensified the images pulated more intensely & the music pulsated & became louder, a great feeling of joy, like being a small child.
"
"It took a second to dissociate the bright white light from heat.To realise my eyes aren’t going to burn. The moment when my focus - on block of the need - kicked in the movement was un Worldly.I feel as if something was unlocked. I come out thinking ""how can a person possibly draw this ? "" . but then I saw down  and couldn't stop. Even though the drawings were shit the ""release’ to want to do them was exhilarating. After this, home,  Phone OFF. Rest"
"It felt like seeing your brain from the inside, really close to your face. I needed to breath in at times cause it was covering the whole of me, taking over my entire body and mind, Sometimes it felt like a tunnel, or strings that will pull your vision far away. Colours  changing from solid, vibrant colours to fractals of many colours moving and blending into one another
Sometimes the cleanest white with colour red and blue will turn into a very dirty mix of purple and brown and as a palet cleansing, it’ll go back to blue, peace calm,  touches of teal, almost like the depth of the spirit. 
"
"Started off as a sunrise a bright glowing sun, that changed into an eye, from which came a series of numbers in a spiral. It was as if I was being provided with all the information, all the knowledge, understanding and wisdom that I crave and work hard to achieve. If only it was that easy. I followed as it turned into cartoon characters, I found I could change their forces & features. It then flashed into a war scene, blood everywhere before coming back to the eye with light coming out of it, in front of it and shapes flashing everywhere. It cuts back to more Scenes of war, almost flashbacks of experiences only ever relayed to me by my clients in the war zones"
"On the beginning I felt the fear, but after few seconds fear go away and the only feeling that left in me was joy and the joy be my company for the rest of the trip. Very powerful experience for my soul but also for my body especially for my brain where I felt some kind of pressure.
After all i felt only peace with me so thank you for that
"
"Completely out of this world experience. At times bright Flashing lights then calming solid colours purple and red.
Sunny beach feeling. Music exciting matching the rhythm of the sounds.
Felt totally relaxed and free. Loads of thoughts about friends and family. Makes me want to explore more ..
"
"At the start I felt a little overstimulated. It reminded me of taking MDMA or 2CB but then I relaxed into the intensity and let the colours and shapes watch over me. At the end I wasn't sure how long I'd been in there as I felt like I had fallen asleep. Which I wouldn't have predicted at the start !! I don't think I was able to draw an accurate picture of what I saw because it felt like what I was seeing changed so regularly. I experienced a lot of geometric shapes and bursts of colours. It felt really relaxing afterwards. I'd loved to have stayed in there for hours to be honest. The music was great. It feels incorrect to describe it as music, it felt more like feeling and pulse, it was so good I almost didn't notice it? It just felt seamless with my being. Thank you to all the people who make this, so special."
"I saw an incredible range of colours and patterns, starting with pale orange but moving iste blues, greens, and purples. The patterns kept rearranging themselves from tunnels, to moving surfaces, and streams. The most unusual thing was that I lost a sense of my own physical presence, not really feeling where my limbs were a space."
"initially it felt like a womb like experiere where I was about to be born , but near the end i realised it wasn't a birth it was a death, I was dying and arriving in a dark calm place."
"I saw shooting stars, swirls, a carpet of minuscule bright blue dots and the most amazing peaceful white light that felt like a warm , cosy blanket.  I felt nervous at first, but as the experience progressed I sank into a deep feeling of relaxation as it seemed to take hold of me and I went into something of a trance - a very content enjoyable trance.
Some of the images that appeared inspired awe or wonder, some joy (so much that I couldn't help but smile)  2, but never fear or anxiety. 
It felt like a story unfolding in front of my eyes, one with no real Beginning
or end, but a very pleasant trip that takes you away from your daily worries and anxieties - and helps you remember that the brightness is always There ... if you give it a chance to shine through. 
"
"Bright dynamic moving shapes and Colours. warm and interactive. As if I was moving
through the Shapes & Colours in a vast Universe. Initially very bright with Strong
reds / oranges / yellow like looking at the Sun. A warm feeling. Then Different Shapes + Colours all moving is different Directions. Very WARM positive feeling, very relaxing
Incredible experience. Lovely to experience something different. Thank you
Such an exceptional experience. The warm welcome from all the team was amazing and set the scene for a great experience. I felt safe and uplifted. A joy
- With mad appreciation to all.
"
"My experience was my own, personal to me but also similar to what others have said in their feedback. I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed this experience and the sense of escapism. I also feel that something like this should be offered as a therapy.
Thank you. 
"
"Hard to put into words ! It felt very relaxing and exciting at the same time.  At first it felt like being on the beach then the colours, shapes & patterns started to emerge - the variety of colours were staggering & the speed at which the shapes changed colour was amazing. 
The music was ethereal & complemented the entire experience superbly.
I was disappointed when it ended - the experience was overwhelming and incredibly enjoyable. 
Thank you!!  
"
Very much like DMT breathing experience. Loved how gentle vibrations let me get to deeper state of being. Physically induced meditative state. Really really enjoyed.
I felt like I was in a cartoon sequence when a character goes on a drug trip or falls into a dream sequence - moments felt like the disney Alice in wonderland when she is falling.
"I had an orgasmic experience. It is something I have never experienced . I felt like I was in a healing machine and my cells really loved it & were renewed  & revived & reactivivated. I was healed from head to toe. A lot of orange, red blood cells coming alive. Penal gland activated. I was swimming in water of life or after life."
"Very relaxed. Time suspended but maybe rushed by. Lots of colour af times quite solid oranges and redish. At times kaleidescope, at time felt like I was falling backwards in a universe. made me feel extremely small. saw a lot of line drawings, like architectural drawings and saw city scape of Rome."
"‘guided’ in the meditation. Maybe I'm too stressed, but I did feel like I was thinking about work. I don't know that I felt ""reborn”. Maybe it's my connection to the building, but it felt like it was inspiring me about what more is possible in the space, wondering what other people thought about the building and what else is possible.
It feels like a burst of calm passion - inspiration is possible, creativity is possible.
"
"I saw a lot of red. There were mainly chequerboard shapes with red and green. A few yellow shapes that felt like being bathed in Sunlight. A few moving through space like an arcade game/star wars starfighter type thing and a field of lavender type purple blooms. 
To be honest I was feeling maybe this could be a cure for my chronic ME/CFS as it could possibly re wire your brain somehow?
"
"I felt a sense of calm & happiness leaving the experience. I saw a lot of geometric shapes & patterns, fractuals.. A lot of colours but mainly reds, yellow & a really rich deep blue colour. At times my eyes werted to focus on the shapes which was difficult. I enjoyed the experience very much. Would recommend it to others.
"
"I was surprised a little bit that it brought some anxiety as well as moments of intense glee. It was hard to relax as my eyes were constantly trying to focus - capture - what they were seeing but this was impossible. I was expecting the kaleidoscopic effects and colours but not the short black lines/dashes that appeared over the top and had no order, just going in all directions. Only one effect produced a feeling of antipathy, this is the one I drew but the drawing of course cannot convey the reaction. "
"I SAW PEOPLE, SO MANY PEOPLE VISITED ME,
FLOWING FLOWING SO MUCH FLOW, AND FLOAT.  LEFT MY BODY A FEW TIMES, DRIFTED OUT OF MYSELF AND AROUND THE ROOM, FELT IT WAS THE ROOM. THE AIR, I BECAME THE MOLECULES OF THE AIR. IT WAS LIKE WE ALL BREATHED AND CONTROLLED THE VISUALS,
I ALSO FELT I WAS OUT OF MYSELF AND WENT INTO THE VISUALS, DANCING
SLIDING, SLITHERING, FLOWING THROUGH - THE IMAGES AND STRUCTURES.
"
"The underlying background was mostly like a marble floor with little lines. There were also lots of cloudy / bubbles as if they were made of smoke coming up
from the bottom of my eyeline. I am colour blind (red/green deficiency) .so
perhaps didn't experience as many colours - they were mostly yellowy.
"
"Very intense at first and almost overwhelming. Began to climatise to it after a few minutes. At the start my chest felt quite tight but I found myself relaxing shortly after. I saw a lot of colourful geometric shapes which morphed shape or colour as the lights changed and the music transitioned. I don't think I ever felt truly disconnected like I was some place else. maybe I was too aware of my surroundings and what was going on around me. I've never taken hallucinogenic drugs before but I can imagine it something similar to what I felt. At the end I felt quite exhausted, but not - in a bad way."
"The music was fairly enjoyable, pleasant sounds and calming notes.
In the later sections the helicopter - like sounds were less enjoyable for me. I felt that the sounds were vibrating my body (stomach and chest and the level was higher than I would normally listen at.
The lights were pleasant to watch, I enjoyed the changes - particulary the vivid blues and purples.
The brighter Yellow light made me feel that the session was due to end - each time! :) 
So I expected it to end several times! 
"
"I enjoyed all of the experience. The staff were welcoming & explained the process.
The first thing I experienced was a bright light which changed to a bright orange Red-Yellow which made me think of lying on in beach on holidays & feeling the heat, it then change to a myriad of colours emitting from a smaller central sphere these changed in shape from - Stars - Spots - Streaks- flashes - I found
myself reflecting on my recent interactions with my grand children - it was lovely to experience that again this part is represented by the Speech bubbles on left hand side of my ""Art work. I also know I fell asleep- cas I wakened myself with my snoring -LOL- I apologize for this :) I checked my watch at the Start & finish, it was about 20+ Mins long -it didn’t seem that long when I was experiencing it-Thank you 
"
"Hard to explain as it was very unique. Felt very relaxed for the most part. Loved seeing the patterns so much, and felt really elated by them, also big sense of wonder about how it was happening. The music helped sink into the experience hugely. Very peaceful and expansive experience. Also time seemed to go really quickly, would have easily experienced it for a whole lot longer."
"A beautiful white light with loads of heat coming from this. I felt a real sense of calmness around this. 
Lots of orange + red images like jellyfish.
Felt like I was flying through space.
I had an image of a hospital bed and hooked up to a machine.
I don’t know if it was me lying in the bed, because I did not feel tricked (?) 
"
"I felt held by those I love. I felt I was being witnessed whilst I moved through the experience - as though something caring was watching over me. A kind, loving presence. It felt as though emotions I had been carrying in my body deep down came up to the surface. It was okay for them to be there. It felt safe. It was like being enveloped by something that cared for me. And it fell as though it had always been there, I just hadn't witnessed it before. It felt like an unburdening, It felt like grace."
"I was slightly sensitive to the light, so I used the eye mask to control the amount of light hitting my eyelids. Nonetheless, my visual experience was beautiful and constantly charging after every break between the light bursts. Most of what I experienced was shape based, lots of fastly paced fractal based sea of Shapes, constantly morphing and flowing into one another. It also reminded me of what I'd imagine the synapses of the mind would look like if you could see them. Before I part put my mask on, the colours / shapes were the most amazing reds, oranges, yellows, all with a beautiful white outlines. The closest I've come to this before was taking mushrooms when I was 15/. Thank you so much. You have something super special here."
"I saw these four petal, spikey flowers. Around the border it was all black flowers on the left red flower, on the right it was yellow flowers.
on the bottom of my sight there was a white/grey chair on the right,  like a village of old houses on the left.
In the centre was a T shape in white Surrounded by yellow & red. I felt really odd at the start, giddy, a little scared maybe. Then in the middle I felt like I spaced out for a bit & I couldn't remember much. I felt more connected to the shapes that reminded me of the sea or the bottom of a swimming pool, rather than the spikier harder images.
"
When it went yellow it was like being in the Sun in a warm country by the sea. Then intense bright colours shifting quickly like some sort of psychedelic rave/going into space.
In the sea diving in and out towards the sun. then in space towards or away from the big bang! 
"Lots of thoughts / memories / visualisations
for some reason it started with the film Gladiator - no idea where that got pulled from.
I don't remember how things transitioned but, on several occasions I found myself running either at dawn or in the evening. Running through thick, moist forests or as the sun came up in an open - beach like environment
There was also a helicopter at one point and I definitely felt a rain forest vibe at that point - a feeling like I was floating or being carried away from the helicopter.
"
"The colours red and blue dominated my experience. - All sorts of varying shapes and patterns too. It's funny how the mind altered the rhythmic patterns I was seeing according to the music. Sometime I had “control"" of what I was seeing, sometimes I totally forgot I had my eyes closed. When coming to the end, as the music faded out I was greeted with something that looked like the outlines of a road in a deep colour. It was a very intense experience that I was able to lose myself in but I wish it lasted longer."
Like a communal sound bath to feel connected with other humans and their energy bodies. I could feel my third eye pulsate and connect with all the other humans around the circle. 
"It started off very sparkly - tiny sparkles of light. The primary colour for me was yellow - which is my favourite colour. It felt at times like I was moving through space at hyperspeed.
Sometimes the colours fractured, sometimes it felt like light on water. The music really helped me let go and experience the colours and sensations fully. I felt like my mind was asking me to let go - to release - to not hold on as tightly. I really loved the seating too - it felt very supportive and relaxing.
"
"Kaleidoscopic , mostly abstract and symmetrical patterns - brightly coloured and sometimes made up of squares, as if pixellated.
Occasionally I saw a deep yellow colour filling my mind.
Once, I saw the face of a young man (only non abstract thing I saw) I felt relaxed and meditative, and in the moment! The music lulled me into a trance state.
"
"What started off as geometric, colourful shapes, turned into more complex and alien patterns as the music got increasingly louder and the lights even stronger. About halfway through, they gave way to different shapes. The most striking was a bird or phoenix with multi-coloured wings that were flaming, and it was flying towards me - surprisingly didn’t feel threatened by it. The lights ended up getting really strong.and my eyes did start to water with the intensity. I did feel a bit overwhelmed but I’m glad I stuck with it. The moments of different shapes, textures and colours I saw every second was incredible! Afterward my head almost felt ‘small’ or less fuzzy - surprisingly felt calm at the end, like colourful meditation/hypnosis. A lot of crosses and rainbows throughout, practically every colour in an abstract pattern and all shapes, some familiar, some alien looming. Last few minutes - I saw every shade of blue and then black, like a summer sky at night. "
"I noticed, particularly after the experience had concluded and I began to perceive others' responses that despite the sensory intensity I largely remained wedded to a familiar space of internal monologue and commentary. Thoughts were on the cultural content of the idea behind the show, whether such a Thing had been done before, what the construction process was like. What governed a decision about how fast The lights flashed, or how the music score interplayed with the visual aspect? What if any, were the set of intentions of the authors. behind the experience, or is the nature of pure subjectivity itself a primary driver? I wondered how the experience would have felt / differed if one were in altered states of consciousness, or on psychedelic drugs."
"I saw a beautiful exploding red sun that warmed my face and as it receded I saw wares of sand dunes crashing down, I could see every single grain of sand in great detail. I felt enanas warmth and peace. Then silently it receded away and I was underwater in the beauty and the vastness of the ocean. I could see the surface above me then later I saw a mass of Stars swirling by me, I was flying through space, and a soft dim star appeared in the distance with a familiar orange glow. I felt like I was going home to a safe place. Then everything turned to black and I saw the Earth suspended in space, a beautiful watery globe spinning in darkness, floating in an infinite void."
"I saw everything. I saw every corner of myself. I thought of my partner, and how happy they make me. I felt emotional. I teared up at the start. felt pure joy."
"I need to come back! may usual state of sleep-drecca- I dream all night. In this space I started to form images but then slipped into deep calm + rest, the visual + thoughts drifted into thoughts & memories in a state of rest and the visual weirdly faded.The thoughts felt like future past & present memory. It felt like the dream machine found my inner AI!"
"Very uncomfortable seat. Had also very cold feet.
Saw bright lights, often in kind of grid like pattern. Very vivid lights very sudden transitions from bright to dark. Default light was kind of dark plane, black purple (slightly grainy). Also went back to a kind of default of green/black (slightly grainy). 
Occasionally opened my eyes. Curious to see what could be causing such bright colours. (Your crayons don't reflect the very vivid colours !). Acid colours went into block colours.
Thoughts: Thank goodness I have eyesight in the world.. Darkness made me think of void of human.
"
"I saw interfence patterns with bright and dark spots. They had different colours/intensities. Initially, there was a very bright light. At the end of the warm up session there was a shimmering blue light. It reminded me of water reflecting on the ceiling in a swimming pool. When the volunteer checked if I wanted to continue I opened my eyes momentarily, and when I closed my eyes again the blue shimmering light was gone. I was a little bit sad about this, the shimmering light had a very comforting effect. During the main event I was looking out for that same comforting blue shimmering light. I still liked the new patterns but I had a strange longing for the pattern at the end of the warm-up. I saw more sea colours, green, blue yellow, there was very little at the ROYBGIV  red/orange side. I think there was some indigo/violet. The colours were beautiful. I lost focus at the end, not sure if I fell asleep or did I check out. I was disappointed (in myself) that I had disengaged. It's bad how much the feeling of doing things right permeates through, everything can there be a right and wrong in a dream machine?"
"Intense orange light, like sunset. Accompanied by the most wonderful feeling of peace to return to something I think I last felt in childhood. Intricate patterns that I never thought would have been possible. Non-symmetrical landscapes with abstract shapes that felt like people. red, blue + white grids - like tooth paste!"
"I saw lots of geometric shapes that would move outwards from my field of vision. I also saw like a tunnel that I was going down in all sorts of colours, it was like I was travelling down it. My body was incredibly relaxed but I did experience intrusive thoughts from time to time about everyday life. I felt very calm even though I felt like I was going on a journey through space almost."
"So many colours and movement. Sun bursts and meadows in sunshine. Like my eyelids became a kaleidoscope. Patterns bouncing and moving. Reds + blues with occasional rainbows. Mostly geometric shapes. Squares and rectangles, six pointed stars, pulling in and out. Lines moving and interesting grids changing colours. Shapes and patterns, like paisley and flowers. forgetting to breathe, focusing on the movements in front of me."
"Like I was in a computer/microchip traveling immensely - I then felt like I was (in) or above the cosmos. Nebulas, saturn.
I then felt the  heat of the Sunshine - Seen the sunflowers grow and grow.
I felt powerful, in control and how  this is where I was always meant to
be ;)
"
"It was relaxing. I saw a lot of colour, all the colours of the rainbow mixed with patterns. At times it felt like I could see the back of my eye balls and I was looking at the light through the colour of my iris-browns, greens, and blues. At first I saw a lot of reds-peaches, strawberry, then lemon and purples. All the colours were vibrant -no dark or deep colours. The patterns were a range of squares, triangles and hexagons, lots of hexagons. The music was not loud at all and merged into the colour scheme - it fitted. There was no dominating shapes. During the light I could see others in the room at the bottom of my vision. I felt chilled but at times my thoughts focused on my outside world but I was quickly able to refocus and concentrate on the colours and shapes.
Great experience.
"
"I felt a little overwhelmed at the start, once I started focusing on my breath I was able to totally relax. I found myself drifting off and then having to focus on the many lights and shapes that I saw. They ranged from geometric, to spotted and even that I saw butterflies. I loved when the light went off and the blue darker lights appeared - widely felt safe. I wasn’t as aware of the music until it started circulate around and got louder as it passed my ears. 
When drifting off I found myself thinking about my loved ones ...
"
"now, certainly interesting, felt calm, relaxed, chair was comfy. Bright lights were initially a little scary. I found my breath as an anchor, I’m here, I’m OK. It’s only light reassurance…relaxed. Light bright, swirling, colours of all sorts of patterns, clockwise, anticlockwise. I found I wondered what the experience would be like without the sound. I let my mind wander and I certainly enjoyed it. "
"A Kaleidoscope of colours. Some images were soothing & some less so. 
Excellent experience all round. Amazed at the amount of colours I saw.
"
"LIKE BEING INSIDE LIGHT. PULSING AND SWOOSHING PATTERNS. LITTLE SHOOTING SPARKS.
YELLO, ORANGE AND PURPLE RED BLUE 
I FELT VERY WARM AND CALM.
I THOUGHT ABOUT DYING BUT DIDN’T FEEL SCARED. I WANT TO LIVE INSIDE THE DREAMACHINE. 
"
"I seen Shapes + Colours, almost as if I were viewing a galaxy at times but much more colourful at times I was totally immersed and surrounded by open space which reminded me of looking at an open sky because of the blue tone I was experiencing.
I felt weightless at times and the whole experience felt much shorter than it actually was. 
"
"I did not know what to expect. But the music and the breathing exercise brought me to a calming (acceptance) space. In the beginning I only see red colours and flames, but it look that when I move focus I saw other colours and other shapes.
I will always remember this experience! The most important lesson I take with me is : accept and focus, only then you experience your own life.
"
"When I was a child, I remember - more than once - closing my eyes, and pressing my thumbs aganst my eyelids until I saw a wash of red and a cascade of sparkling stars. It was slightly painful , but uniquely special too - hence being dumb enough to do this more than once. Having never dabbled with hallucinogenics for fear they would melt my fragile brain, this experience today felt as close to that experience from my childhood as I will ever get. At times it really felt too much, but thankfully never was. Totally magical. I'm still computing it. Thank you!"
"overwhelming -  it was almost too much, actually think it was too much. I couldn't stop crying in the beginning (taster) I almost wanted to leave - I mean I could have left-bright bright orange - very geometrical shapes - it was terrifying as it's all in me- I understand it rationally but the feels are of absolute terror-terrifying.  I had to keep breathing breathing breathing. I liked the idea but I was too present, which meant it was too much."
"I saw purple, orange and flickering images of a cross and the face of christ. I feel I had
just “died” and had passed from the physical into the realm of the “Spirit”. All fear had gone. I felt totally at peace. I felt my body had gone and I was transformed into spirit, beyond the material and beyond space and time. I felt I was part of the infinite, expanding universe. I imagined I could see, feel and experience what it was like to be a fundamental particle that is the basis of all matter like an electron, ineson, boson or neutrino. I felt at one with creation and was travelling through space and time. I felt grateful for my human experience and physical form and felt closer to understanding the meaning and purpose of suffering, pain and the human experience. I felt it was a magical, peaceful experience of my own creation. 
"
"it's very difficult to explain or draw, it was incredibly varied. Lots of structured coiled shapes - yet some connection to nature - Peaceful - Ocean - Desert Space - Ocean Creatures - peace 
One stage I think I seen/felt presence of me as child. My body feels rest yet l am exhausted. So many geometric shapes. Some parts reminded me of 1980es powerpoint.
"
"starting with a white background, lots of squares all over the over space with spots swirls in the middle.
As time went on it felt like I had a UK headset on as I looked around.
At the end there was a lot of red light coming in and at points there was zooming in and out of the view. The background was very white at all times as the colour changed. 
"
"very different, made me feel alive! My eyes are tired from all the different shapes & lights. At times I felt a bit anxious with the bright strobe light, as it made me feel a bit drunk
all in all well done + thank you :)
"
"I felt like I was still thinking thoughts or worries I usually have but it was nice to have them combined with sensory stimulation. To kind of travel with your thoughts. I expected to feel overwhelmed & fearful but I didn’t. Was surprisingly pleasant for something so intense. Really liked the blanket + comfort + permission + checking in. 
Taster was also a great idea.
"
I fell through space. Then jumped and dived through time. The speed of movement & direction of movement changed with the beauty of the music. I enjoyed every second of it. 
"I'd like to know what is the theoretical/Scientific background of the effect of flashing lights? 
What is the point of this experience?
Maybe I will have some additional thoughts afterwards in a day or two. 
What about varying brain waves?
Could this be dangerous?
Initial overriding thought is this is reminiscent of a [drug? DMT?] trip.
"
"Colours obviously were more determined by the darkness and light amount and mixed well with the soundtrack.
I felt the right side of my experience was more predominant with light rays shooting down to the left the speed determined by the music.
It was a really good experience in terms of being in the moment as to fully “see” your experience I had to full focus on the moment.  If I had problems concentrating this would be a good thing to do more regularly. . Another point about the light patterns is that the taster the music they were almost like small build ups of anxiety then when it got darker or the music changed to a softer sound then the rays stopped sort of like a release of anxiety/relaxation. 
"
"Took some time to settle into it, felt like the room was spinning after a night out.
Felt quite woozy made me want to fight it + open my eyes. Once I got used to it, I was able to settle & go with the flow. patterns began to roll into one. The music really helped to relax as the louder it got the more jumbled the patterns became.
"
"Lots of multicoloured geometric patterns, retreating + moving forward + right to left.
Patterns repeated in the same colours alternating but remaining the same.
There were a constant backdrop of like crackly old cine film raining down behind any other experience.
Sometimes it looked like mathematical symbols. 
Fascination was the overwhelming emotion. Great experience - I'll go again.
"
"I seen all the families getting ready to go to the place of Worship. A weekly
pilgrimage to see their family friends and be part of a bigger family and community. The mums organising the children to get dressed and take a younger sibling by the hand. I felt like I was witnessing something innocent, clean and pure with no contamination. Then I hear and seen ambulances, police and army violently going to mini warzones to assist the daily traumas in this not so innocent Community, the cruel darkness awaited the innocent young children when they left the sanctuary of their place of Worship. I felt the different tradesmen discussing their daily tasks and what they for lunch (“......again”)
"
"I felt very relaxed throughout the experience. During some stages my eyes felt quite uncomfortable but then it soon passed. 
When the light was a bright orange/yellow colour, it reminded me of being on holiday. During the blue phases I felt like I was flying on a spaceship.
"
"Very relaxing, happy feeling. Patterns of dots/circles/grids. Could have stayed for longer, music was awesome. "
"I saw lots of grid shapes, fast moving colours. "
"In the best possible way - nothingness/peace.
Thank you
"
one very uncomfortable shape (made me feel uncomfortable) I took this shape as the hardships and challenges in life so decided to own it and - control the shape once I did I could feel myself smile really wide and had an overwhelming joyful feeling. Also had flashes of walking through a forest at a festival.
"I wouldn't say there was very much of an emotional quality to my experience, but the visuals were very strong, right from the start. The most common type of experience I had was of rushing through geometric hallways, or being inside a vortex rushing past me towards some termination point/ Singularity just outside my field of view. The walls of the vortex were always covered in some kind of shapes, often small circles stacked end-to-end, sometimes the walls enveloped me and became a corridor that I was rushing through towards the part. Occasionally I started to see objects that I tried to focus on and enhance, but the frequency/ intensity of the lights would shift before I could get a proper handle on anything."
"incredibly intense pulsating light to begin with causing a sensation that was rather uncomfortable, created heavy racing chest and tight jaw! Breathing helped these sensations subside and reduce significantly; intense patterns of shapes of green & yellow & blues that created experience of speed & rushing in the dark. 
A maze of the colours occurred in synchronicity with soundtrack/music that constantly changed & pulled my eyes up/down/side to side - feelings of deep relaxation compared to the start were hard to draw me out of the experience. 
I’d love to try this first thing in the morning, evening times. I am always super tired so would be interesting to see when the body has had deep rest & its effect on the start of the day. Class!
"
"This experience was quite overwhelming at times (in a good way). It felt as though you had motion sickness and you were part of a 3D journey moving with the shapes and patterns. You find yourself longing for the periods of calmness but excited again for it to move faster and brighter. At the end it felt like a helicopter was bringing you back down to earth and someone was Shaking you, letting you know you could wake up again from a mad dream. I feel like the entire way through your wondering how bright white lights can create such different and sparklingly opposing colours and shapes etc. A truly memorable experience and something I’ve never experienced before."
"I came out of the experience feeling deeply relaxed and slightly tearful but pleasant tears with lightness. I saw my images of my late mum, laughing . I saw my late brother as a child too. I said hello to them both. The beginning of the experience was beautiful, visually I felt like I was in space with lots of stars moving past me. Lots of shapes and colourful moving patterns were constantly evolving. It was very enjoyable and dream-like. The music very serene and immersive ♡"
"I felt like I was flying through air and underwater. Felt disconnected from my body.
Spinning in a carrousel, travelling through the air. 
Feeling warm, relaxed, safe yet exhilarated. 
"
"What struck me was how other senses were drawn in. It was as much an emotional journey. There were periods of sadness and despair, even panic, followed by release, peace and contentment. There was also a strong sense of wanting to control things, there was an endless conflict between wanting to let go and wanting to stay in control. Fight or flight. There was a point I reflected it was like a journey through life starting with bright light of birth and entry into the world, the traumas and exhilaration of life and finally a calm of later years and acceptance of death. 
The colours were the most intense after the white light faded with fluorescent greens and blues. There was quite a few tunnel experiences, traveling through tunnels of light. 
I could also make out figures as line drawings. Overlapping each other and performing various life tasks. 
Definitely the most striking thing was the emotions and how they moved between extremes.  
"
"I never knew I could see so much with my eyes closed. I began to think about things that I haven't thought about in years but then the experience brought me back to the room again.
The music calmed me at the end so much that I thought I was under water looking up to really bright light.
"
"It started with a small shield type shape - reds and yellows/oranges. To take over the bright yellow with grid patterns, zig zags and spirals. 
Shapes started to move around and come together and form more complex patterns. I interpreted these as animals. Gorilla, lion, parrot/bird.
Saw a dragonfly many times. It initially appeared as lightning bolts coming together. Then forming a dragonfly with flapping/fluttering wings travelling for forwards at a very fast rate. 
"
"Sky, clouds, squares and circles - a mix of all shapes but never the same one at the same time, bright lines connecting the shapes. Felt like I was moving at high speed when the music became more intense. When the lights stop that's when I saw the clearest shapes form and then collapse into the middle.
Thanks x 
"
"I felt like I was moving between land, sea and space. At times almost like breaking through time + space Sometimes I could visualise people + places and felt like I was able to hear them speaking.
Sometimes the intensity made me feel anxious. I loved every colour that I could see - it honestly was like being in the fabric of the universe without the distractions of physicality. Just Light + sound. Thank you.
"
I felt in awe of what my mind could create through sound + light. Knowing the light was only whit elight but my mind showed all the colours of the rainbow. Different shapes appeared and went. A whole kaleidoscope of shapes. I looked up and down while keeping my eyes shut and seen shapes coming up from the bottom + down from the top. It was wondrous. 
"I wasn't able to enjoy the full experience + had to wear the eye mark for the majority of the time. My eyes throbbed, particularly the left one + I felt like I was getting a headache - initially just from strobing light but subsequently from brightness. I did however feel immersed in the audio experience & found myself drifting to somewhere with sunsets, palm tree’s + budget clubbing vibe!"
"Potentially saw every colour known.
Very visual patterns, changing direction left to right, back to front , closer to me to further away - Every time I felt like I blink the pattern changed. At times I saw block colours with very small structural patterns that were very tiny. One was like a lot of hexagon shapes attached.
Sensations I felt like my eyes kept slightly opening, other times felt like I was swaying side to side like spinning but just my head. Another time felt the pattern move closer to me that I was slightly pushed back into my seat.
"
"Very relaxing, therapeutic in fact.
The images were not something I’ve ever experienced and the music was perfect (Harmonious) with the images. 
Well done to those who created this. This is pure art.
(It is hard to describe the images, the colours and shapes sore almost indescribable"
"Moments of calm followed by small bursts of panic. The moments where I saw one constant colon felt fearful, but it wouldn't last. Eventually I learned to be at peace with it and found the experience relaxing, It reminded me of being underwater, then as if I was alone the clouds."
I felt like I was in an emotionally void place - the opposite of how I usually feel.
"I felt like I was travelling at different points of the experience, a real feel of movement back or forwards or through things. The Shapes & colours changed quite a bit when I closed my eyes more/less tightly or changed if I was looking to the side or looking straight ahead. It also sometimes felt like being inside a 1990 science video that we would watch in school:  like Seeing loads of genes multiply or flying through Space or being inside the human body. I felt quite relaxed & Spaced out – once I’d settled into the experience. Sometimes it felt joyful - particularly around the experiences of movement/travel. I felt very held/ supported by staff / all access support."
"I was very aware of my eyes, felt actively focusing one eye - as if seeing out of one. 80-85% violent red, against/with white. Fleeting moments of blue/green - gentler colours but when my brain registered it was a different set of colours they disappeared. At points felt like I was falling forward into a net but mostly the red was coming out towards me. My body was very tense and breathing exercises didn’t help release the tension. Felt a strong desire to back away when the images were red. The taster session was 100% aggressive red. "
"So relaxed, Happy. I felt like I was being took up in helicopter could see the man flying it clearly. Could see a word but couldn't make it out seen it a few times. Very good experience."
"Like being inside a kaleidoscope... flying through space, spinning… Mario kart track? When the hashes were bigger (?) I was seeing squares and as the noise & flashes became quieter and calme I saw blobs & circles. Felt like all the space around me was moving & I was weightless. At times as the spinning got really quick I was a little worried about being dizzy. But it was ok. Normally as this happened then the shapes calmed again. Towards the end I was seeing more colour in the flashes - red, orange, blue, purple, and pink 
:) 
thank you
"
Such a surreal experience - immersed in colourful geometric patterns and shapes. towards the end I felt an internal journey into the very fabric of my mind/being and just when I thought it was at its smallest it went further and further. - Amazing!!! 
"warm- red lights circle shapes to begin changed to mandelas, spirals, stars and beautiful shapes as the music progressed.
Bright neon colours, pinks, blues, oranges and yellows. 
stars, planets, galaxies unfolded in front of my eyes. I felt a sense of bliss when the red lights felt like a warm sunlight - could literally feel my face warm. Felt relaxed and inspired by the colours and experience.
I would love to try again and see if I had a different experience. 
"
"The experience for me was amazing. I did not know what to expect before entering the dream machine but the curiosity in me was eager to find out what this was all about. I have to say
I was blown away by the experience and I am so glad I booked it. I didn't think anything like this existed and I would love for everyone to experience this.
I felt very relaxed and wanted the experience to last longer. It's also great to see at the end that everyone's drawing of their experience was very different. How light can make this fantastic experience so amazing it's something I will remember for the rest of my life. AMAZING!
"
"A kaleidoscope - broken pieces of colour - beautiful. Peacock colours, fireworks, jesus’ face with a crown of thorns and eyeballs, red, black and white boxes. I felt relaxed, like I was somewhere else. I saw the sun/sunhaze + felt like I was on holiday. Warm, comfortable. "
"The main experience was one of constant flux, energy, movement - flow.
The music felt warm and soft and allowed me to relax into the visual experience. 
Lots of geometric patterns which were constantly evolving and changing shape + direction.
Occasionally the shapes would take on forms - a boat, figures, hands, flowing in and out of likenesses and pure geometry. 
Time fell away and it felt like it came to an end faster than I wanted! Could have stayed all day! 
"
"An array of colours appearing in different shapes, shades and sizes. At one point I seen rockets shooting into the air. The feeling at times felt intense and something kept appearing on the left but I found it difficult to hone in on it. It looked like a picture and I was thinking marble at the time. 3 bright shining stars appeared and were twinkling light in a background of red, blue with orange. I at times felt like I was flying through a kaleidoscope of beautiful shapes & colours and was very calming. Towards the end it seemed like millions of ants were crossing sand (desert)
I also felt at one stage like the burning sun was glistening off open water and calm waves. 
"
"I saw colours & shapes - a lot of squares & triangles
my eyes started to water halfway through 
I saw a lot of star shaped light 
I felt alone and I didn't like it I had to open my eyes to see everyone else
my parents were there but I didn't feel like they were experiencing the same
thing.
"
"I was overwhelmed and surrounded by an orange - pink blanket with a pulsing centre that would bring me into a different sky with shapes & colours that I've never seen before. The sky would move in a million different directions and shapes would rapidly change, as would colours - a complete Kaleidoscope. I would then return to the orange - pink emptiness and have a feeling of serene calmness + bliss. I didn't think much throughout + I felt disconnected from my body. It felt like 5 minutes had passed."
"Kaleidoscope (sic) images, vibrating with the sound. Alien like symbols animating and changing, cascading (like the MATRIX) - only not green. 
felt like an information download,
Geometric shapes especially at the start - I hope when we die we see the beautiful white light like this. A great sense of peace, belonging, knowing.
Some of the images reminded me of the experiments relating to the memory of water. It felt like I was seeing the music.
Also reminds me do some experiences of hemi-sync sounds. Time definitely went faster.
"
"I felt completely relaxed, initially the taster session felt a bit intense but in no way uncomfortable. At first I saw a bright solid colour like burnt orange which widened into my held of vision. I saw lots of blues, yellow, orange and as the music heightened I had more flashing images. Sometimes the visions seemed to repeat and they would recede. It was an amazing experience; lots of the images reminded me of sunsets and it felt like time passed really quickly."
"Lots of patterns, most of the time too complex to describe but occasionally organising into vast geometric patterns.
Repeating patterns, nets, blood vessels, vortexes which spin in different directions.
Cross shapes, St Bridgets’s cross shapes?
Dots, blobs and spirals, sound, vibrations, visualised. Amazing :) 
"
"Felt relaxed, enjoyed the experience.
Thank you! :) 
"
I found myself smiling during the experience. Most relaxing. 
"Felt a bit nervous, scared at the taster like my heart was going to explode. I caught myself wanting to laugh and my eyes began to water a bit. I settled in a bit more for the main session. Felt like i was drifting in and out of consciousness. Saw so many shapes, lots of colours. The bright white light felt like I had died & was waiting at the gates of heaven, seeing if I was going to get in. Also had thoughts of what I had been doing earlier in the day but can't remember now. It was a totally weird, yet wonderful experience."
AT TIMES I FELT LIKE I WAS FREE FALLING THROUGH SPACE WITH SUDDEN CALM AND FEELING OF WEIGHTLESSNESS.
"At first the intense brightness felt almost unbearable. This feeling passed by quickly as different images and shapes emerged. I then began to enjoy the anticipation of what I would next see. I
was surprised how many geometric shapes rather than rounded shapes appeared. At times it was so dark and l got confused - did I have my eyes stilll closed - or were they open in a dark room. I was amazed by what my mind produced and how this is unique to me.
I wished I could photograph it . To capture it in drawings afterward did not do it justice.
"
"I was excited going into the experience. After the guided Breath Work, I was super chilled with a cheesy grinon my face. It started with a bit of orange light that slowly filled to my entire view. I felt warm. And then I felt a pull toward this white light, this was awesome. A mixture of calm euphoria here. Then, pretty quickly it was kaleidoscope city, my eyes were working hard to keep up, but stayed cool and began to enjoy loads of different patterns, spinning, twisting, pulsating sequences that increased and decreased in speed with the music. This was cool. I’ve never experienced such calm in a hyper experience like this. I felt like I had double the real estate in my field of view, it was awesome. Felt pretty happy, calm, didn’t want it to end lol. Want to try this again. "
"Moving at a fast pace through black figurines against a white background. 
Many moving dots + colourful shapes darting in various directions + patterns. 
A sensation of relaxation + an overwhelming feeling of peace + safety. 
"
"I felt like I was in a tunnel, moving towards the light. I seen lots of red & black patterns of shapes, mostly Squares, rectangles & lines. A reoccuring dark blue & light blue pattern with a  + shape made me feel safe & seemed to calm me when my thoughts. were rapidly changing."
"Incredibly calm- all my images were associated with the sea, the sun. The beach is the place where I am happiest and most at peace. I felt absorbed by sunlight, warm and happy. The time went by so quickly - I could have stayed for hours. My head and body felt fully immersed in the experience. Meditation on another level, I felt fully ‘here’ but also in an incredibly safe space. Can’t wait to try it again. "
"I felt like I was going through space at the speed of light. I felt as though I was moving or spinning really fast. I saw a Kaleidoscope of colours, blue, red, yellow. I saw shapes, lines and patterns which sometimes broke off into lots of smaller shapes or patterns as the light frequency changed. I saw lots of dots which flickered like stars..
I feel as though I had an almost expanded view or Vision, like the dream machine opened up my mind.
"
It felt like I was on the very ease of falling asleep the whole time. My body kept twitching ne awake  just as I started to drift off. I saw a Kaleidoscope of colours & shapes & at one point could really see an eye in the very centre of my vision! I found the tester quite stressful but the actual experience was extremely relaxing and soothing.
"I couldn't believe the amount of different patterns and colours that I could see. One of my eyes is weaker than the other, during the day I notice it - some things are out of place and my depth perception is iffy sometimes.
During the experience this didn't matter, it was just a full screen-like world of exploding colours. I didn't feel like opening my eyes at all (and I thought I would). I didn't want to ruin the show that my mind was showing me!
It's hard to describe, I saw geometric shapes and little vortex - like spirals and holes. I felt a bit breathless at some points and had to remember to breeeathe. Awesome.
"
"I felt deeply relaxed almost drifting in and out of sleep, hovering in the luminal space between sleep and awake state. I could feel my body totally relaxed but my mind incredibly stimulated. But now I can’t remember anything I was thinking about. I kept catching myself in thoughts that made no sense so indicated to me I was in a luminal space then the flashing lights would pull me elsewhere. I believe symbols and geometry is sacred and holds a language/form of consciousness that we are perhaps unable to comprehend so I’m intrigued to see if I have recovered any downloads or if they will appear or [. . . . . ] this evening when I sleep. At the beginning I could feel my thoughts soften and go to a place of ease and restfulness. Very similar to how I felt when taking psychedelics in the past. Reminding me a lot of the after glow effect of ‘magic mushrooms’. Very at ease, very peaceful, very playful almost. So I think if there was an ancient, incomprehensible language being transmitted to me via geometric patterns then it was a conversation reminds me that everything is going to be ok, that we are here to have fun and enjoy ourselves. It was very beautiful, very playful, very grounding. Reminded me of the magic we hold in our senses, sight, auditory and sensation. Thought it was a wonderful experience. :) "
My thoughts were very loving. I felt extremely calm and was able to reflect on some of my close relationships from a place of love with an urge to show these relationships more of that side of myself.
Bathed in a warm light - not floating or lying down but somehow held…very safe and relaxed. A deep sense of wellbeing. Pulsing grid patterns almost like honeycombs. 
Reminded me of my flickering PC screen and impending migraine so had to give up on the visual aspect! However really respondful to the sound track - felt my heartbeat everything with the beat of the music and felt more and more relaxed with the crescendo. Was very hard to resist the urge to dance to the music - I wanted to move to the middle of the room and dance. 
"Felt oddly happy at the beginning. I almost laughed out loud.
I loved the light + colours, really vivid. It was a bit of a journey. 
It was a but like how I would imagine the initial stages of dying. 
"
"Sometimes it was places, shapes, colours, sensations. Felt safe, bathed in light. "
"Pyramids - a lot. -Blue (black/orange). 
Corners of cubes being peeled back to reveal other universes.
Human like silhouettes moving and sitting down beside me.
Feeling of a seeing under the surface of water (orange)
Saw & felt like I was transported to an entirely unknown place but felt calm.
Viewing shapes from a distance I felt like I could control what I wanted to see at this point.
White + black kaleidoscope.
"
"Felt that intersection of grief & delight on realising how small, microscopic I felt - so many of the images were constellation like. Most enduring image was as though I were several metres underwater, water caustics to shafts of sunlight above, and entirely bathed orange as though in a lowering sun. The orange brightened & whitened and the sense pivoted as though I were in air rather than in water. Heavenly maybe. There's a horribly solitary quality to life nowadays and sense this conjureded of me going/journeying to be with someone was so unexpected and moving. I was stirred to think what cosmic things, interstellar really my own mind created between my eyes. There's such explosive & dynamic possibility within one mind; such a wide, vivid conceptual space is one mind Peace, toe. GRMA."
"it was difficult sometimes to know whether my eyes were open or closed, but they were closed, an intensely relaxing experience, almost felt as if I was half asleep. The colours changed from white fireworks, the fine kind, to deep green and blue globules of colour ebbing and flowing.  The orange and blue colours varied in intensity but was more of a Kaleidoscope overall. A contented, Joyful experience."
"I saw lots of brightly coloured lights  - bright yellow + orange + yellow, which produced images likes birds wings flapping. It was like being inside a kaleidoscope. At one stage the light seemed to be engulfing me. I thought it was very relaxing. a felt sleepy a found a lot of the music to be quite pleasing."
"It is super relaxing - an amazing experience actually, but to be honest I don't like this organised reflection bit, kind of takes the magic of it away. I’d rather sit in the dark for longer and sit and think about it alone."
"A little galaxy, inside a hexagonal pattern circling around and the galaxy getting smaller and smaller away. 
Thought about death and infinity.
Felt relaxed after initial concern about going blind. I feel very happy afterwards.

"I had a brief, very tangible experience, a vision of what for flung futuristic architecture would look like. Triangular, white and black, moving pottems.
I also saw (momentarily) two anonymous fascist forces marching past this architecture/decor.
I also saw the sea, the sun, I flew into space. My baby Jack hurt his leg. Rishi Sunik was there. One man protested against the Dreamachine but then claimed the negative reaction he faced was ""his artwork"" and he looked very smug. 
I journey a lot. Impossible distances. Gravity defying. At one point I felt as it my entire body was being scanned by a magical blue light and I felt my limbs tingle. I skimmed the sed (like a bird I guess). I swam in the bluest waters.

"I could see fractal patterns like I was in a kaleidoscope but I felt like I was moving around them. At the end I felt like I was going.sinking deeper into water which is a really relevant experience. 
The period between these two parts I found really reflective, revisiting specific moments, important moments.

"Vivid waves , transportation at speed from sunrise to sunsets. Forced relaxation, that was joyful.  Beautiful experience that felt bigger than real life."
"Felt a connection with the subconscious mind. 
Felt very light & relaxed. 
Feeling of lifted and transported into space. 
Kept swinging between virtual reality and actual reality. 
Found myself dreaming quite often.
Even dozed off for a while. 
Felt like sunrise & sunset, a timelapse of it. 
Felt like being in a galaxy. 
Had a feeling of floating in space.
Lost track of time. 
Distressed & soothing feeling. 
Felt peaceful and a feeling of connection into my deeper self. 
Mind seemed to have first detached from my body. 
Had a feeling of visiting a parallel world. 
Music felt like healing.

"I kept wanting to see something and I adjusted my expectation as the experience progressed. 
For the most part I was witness to a disorientating roulette wheel, but as I relaxed my eyes I was able to see more detail behind the lights, meaning the under layer (?). I saw interconnected numbers in the underlayer, notably the number 3. A symmetrical purple wobble at the end as if the fluid in my eyes was leaking. Not to be morbid
