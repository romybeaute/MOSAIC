Intense chaos. And then my mind checked out and my subconscious took over and started talking. What I imagine it's like looking back on life before you die.
"good stuff."
a pattern of red and white lights that flashed and became more intense when the lights flashed intensely. I also felt sleepy for a bit and I was thinking of my partner who I could visualize
I went back to many hard and mostly beautiful memories without prompting them at all.
Hello
Hope as a color
dreaming while awake- flashes of random places I have been. maybe this is what it's like to be dead.
"Being: immersed; calm; and thrilled."
"life after retirement"
"I dreamt myself as a harbinger of the new planet, shaping the world with life and equity, I wish to belong there with someone I really loved and missed..."
"relaxation, calm, and curiosity"
"Personally it was hard for me to find peace with the intensity of the bright light. My eyes wouldn't stop watering so that kept my mind occupied. Still a really cool experience!"
was like taking hallucinogenic drugs when I was younger
the closest thing I'll ever experience to being on drugs
"Incredible technicolor experience"
"At one point, the light darkened and my vision shifted to a field of blue - one that I recognized as the same deep shade of Derek Jarman's film."
"incredible colors and patterns. I tended to shift between focusing on the sound or the colors. it was difficult to hold both equally present"
"geometric kaleidoscope shapes overlaid with moving cosmos/night sky slow exposure in different pulling directions
it was as if I was moving through a portal through time and space"
sound inside my body
"I saw many shapes and colors, usually swirling and falling around me, as if I was moving through a vortex or a tunnel. They were often red and orange but sometimes bluey green, as if underwater."
"it kind of felt like dying, reincarnating, and starting life again. I also felt like seeing the origin of our galaxy and trying to understand the meaning of life."
past memories and people not really in my life anymore
"I saw stars and hexagons tessellating twisting and zooming out left and right in reds blues and greens against a galactic background I wanted to engage more it annoyed me when it started and stopped as my brain was developing themes, the louder the music the better, I would have liked a slight diffusion on the light or something to keep my eyes shut the intensity was demanding me to open my eyes I was very conscious of my mind thinking about stopping thinking in the end that was funny. I couldn't help thinking what would happen with a drum beat maybe allow some non-European music in much as I love John Hopkins"
a calm peaceful state. blissful even. the vastness was just poetic and beautiful
"towards the end, I felt like I was slowly floating upwards"
"numerous random shapes, sometimes geometric sometimes just dots.
feeling of things coming at you. A sense of traveling along a galaxy highway towards the end"
"In a web of gold against the dark of the universe I saw energy, the connection between all things
I was in a domed tower full of stars, mountains, and arches appeared to me before they surrendered to geometry
Falling and then being lifted through tunnels, I felt I was ascending to the warmth of the sun and then I saw the waters moving on the face of the earth, covering all, into deepness and outside of time
It felt close to a religious experience, and profoundly moving and elating."
"the music is calming and surreal
the sensory is overwhelming and powerful
I was scared at first but calmed down after a while
it feels like a symbolism of acceptance of self, my own fear and life
it is a unique experience I won't forget"
"intense geometric shapes spiraling into a deep ocean blue circle. The most vivid memories of my Dad carrying me on his shoulders as a young girl; it felt like I was back there for a short while. Dream Machine is an unforgettable, magical and life-affirming experience."
"I saw a kaleidoscope like my childhood toy and then abstract space, dunes, sunshine"
"At first it was unsettling because there were these lights flashing like a kaleidoscope in front of my eyes, even though my eyes were closed.  I didn't feel in control and wondered how this would be positive.   But then I found I could shut it out if I wanted and was able to relax -almost falling asleep at times,
In the experience, the colors changed and the patterns.   Sometimes it was like sunrise and other times like something from science  fiction with blue backgrounds and white linked rectangles."
"good beats leading me on
helpful and positive ambient sounds"
felt similar to being in an MRI machine. also the same with unsuccessfully trying to fall asleep during an insomnia period
"deep relaxation and a sense of hope. it made me feel positive and as though something is guiding me.i saw a deep red heart in the distance as well as flowers, glitter, skies, an eye and an owl"
"a range of emotions. patterns, color and movement. and a sense of really being inside my head."
"I had many different visuals or experiences. One was the ocean, other a house in grass fields near cliffs next to the ocean, other I was approaching Heaven and one of the last ones was at Walworth Road."
devtest
"this was my second time, this experience was more black and white and cold blues, with grids and fractals. the previous was with pink tones and vortexes and a sensation of flying in a wormhole"
"Bright blue skies. A waterfall flowing backwards. A Flock of birds. The universe?"
Dreaming Dreamingly
"flying through colorful vortex
overwhelming vast space and I was insignificant"
"confusion
difficult to make note of what I was seeing as I've never experienced that before
I also felt happy and smiled at certain points which was quite weird"
"an amazing sense of harmony, balance, and oneness, visually a moving mandala"
Sense of comfort. Connection to an inner peace. Calm and safe
Spirals and pulsing
"I felt very peaceful, euphoric, a sense of wonder and awe"
"I felt like a flower slowly unfurling in the sunlight
or like a trippy Mickey Mouse in a 1940s Disney animation... as seen through a kaleidoscope"
"there were points that the intense chaos broke into a clear defined counterclockwise spiraling tunnel with two small semi-circles at the
center going the opposite way"
"1st time it felt more like it was separate from me, in front of my vision. 2nd time it was all around. vast. no difference between me and what was happening. it was a bigger more profound but almost intense."
the dreamachine has put me in quite a strange but amazing mood and I want to catch that while it's still there. it is very sensitizing and the feeling now is one of afterglow. it is very wonderful seeing the deep textures and powdery lights that arise in your vision. the best bit was taking in the feelings of the music and gliding with it and morphing those visions according to how you feel about the music. I had a memory from my childhood of spending lots of time staring at the windows media player audio visualizer while listening to songs I liked and how that seemed amazing at the time. and this made me think about synesthetic experiences and how they're very precious and worth seeking out and appreciating. like this - music is a very visual thing
Journey forward. And then maybe backwards. Slow and fast. Then really fast. And really slow...... and so many fractals and colors!
VCA fuzz and patterns
I had a good experience with this and surprise how sensation can play with our mind and emotions. Thanks for the experience.
"A wheat field
A girl in summer
A roller coaster speeding
A bird flying out of the earth's atmosphere and into space
A sun covered in creamy milk
A swim in the deep ocean
A sky coming towards me
A feeling of being in a cocoon, in the womb"
"a sense of moving through a portal, being transported. like the end of 2001 viewed through a kaleidoscope wearing kaleidogoggles. immense."
"I saw some Vasarely like artworks but in motion. Sense of time was weird, the experience felt really short. Bright light was a bit hurting but overall experience was amazing."
"I experienced absolute chaos which mirrors how I'm currently feeling. It was very emotional. I saw every combination of shape and color, seemingly combining at random."
would love an experience with continual stimulation without breaks to see how the images evolve
a variety of lights and colors moving inward and outwards
"I felt both relaxed but also stimulated, the brightness and frequency of the flickering felt that I was being attacked, yet I never felt scared or weak"
it was possible to generate full images on demand - elephant made of upwards flowing oil rivulets
it was like riding Willie Wonka's boat through the crazy tunnels in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
a peaceful experience
Sound created the visuals and created a pattern of energy movement across my body
"Helicopter, busy mind, no rest, relentless, stuck."
"I became the music and the music became me, and we were floating and flying in a multidimensional kaleidoscope of the most beautiful geometry, symmetry, and color"
"submission
fun
mild euphoric moments"
"I felt like I was on a journey through space riding in a kaleidoscope... it was an out of body experience on occasion, and I felt a spinning sensation and like I could see galaxies and star clusters all around my invisible kaleidoscope spacecraft. felt my body was being lifted and traveling through the universe. it was profound.
throughout I felt calm but exalted."
"how I would like to next make some felt artwork
"
"I felt a confusing sense of place, a familiar place, like my grandmother's basement, or a train station, but I couldn't place it. the sensation was very strong, and I struggled to find the memory that matched the feeling. I knew where I was, but felt this strong pull to this other familiar place just beyond my remembering
Sure am glad I wasn't on drugs!"
"moving through a tunnel of branches
no green I did not see any green at all from start to finish"
I was riding a ray of some sort flying over a barren Icelandic desert. then I was spinning through the universe.
"trying to remember the patterns
"
kaleidoscope of colors
"memories, meditation, swimming, weightlessness, space"
"I felt in clouds, holding my breath
"
"I profound sense of relaxation I have never experienced. With this came
a pure connectivity with my body and a slight floating sensation."
absolutely tripped away. so good I came n experienced the experience u set up
"Awesome experience and not what I expected. Sometimes verging on oppressive, but never scary. Very well led."
not wanting my thoughts to overtake the experience
thousands of fluttering butterfly wings. flying through space at incredible speed. phosphorescence on water. a Welsh blanket. my mother's blue handmade patchwork quilt. tessellations. hexagons. the overwhelming beauty of spinning on this planet. a childhood memory of staring through my glittering eyelashes into the rainbow bright sun.
"not much at all
"
"First there was resistance, once this was gone, there was bliss. I saw the most colorful mandalas keeping pace with the beats in perfect synchronicity. I am amazed, never experienced something equal. I am beyond words...
"
I found my thoughts developing into stories and images while my eyes were closed. the vast colors my brain generated were as impressive as an art gallery
"I saw film strips with my sons lips on, a giant whooshing manga dragon, focused grass and slate through little windows and stained glass"
relaxing and reflective     worries stopped / put in proportion
Joy
"I found myself lost in thought near the end, and stopped being aware of visual experience and just thought about stuff. Similar stuff to what I normally think about.
I wonder if it didn't work, because I was too tall for the chair."
"an incredible kaleidoscopic journey of set ambitions of colors and shapes that took on different dimensions. it was like flying and crashing through different dimensions. shockingly vivid white and red and black, angular kaleidoscope with 3d elements that grew into textured physical forms within the kaleidoscope, blue mist of dots on a black void, like space, a tunnel of pink and yellow round shapes, an incredible deep orange that morphed and bred amazing new forms and a calm turquoise blue with hints of yellow like a gradient sunset "
"an interesting one.
"
PEACEFULNESS AND GUIDANCE
"towards the end a washing machine spin going into a helicopter moving from different positions.
"
"this is exactly how I remember being on LSD was, without the scary parts"
"Initially a spiral, like a spool of old film running off a projector. Figures standing as though about to dance. star fields. Reminiscent of 2001 and the stargate. and then, oddly, Robbie Williams!"
how my brain hallucinates on the go
"I felt like I was in my parents house but couldn't figure out which room. I then felt like I was in my old house (shared with an ex) and walking on my daily commute towards my old front door. I felt like I was walking with my dog. All normal experiences usually but this time everything was scary. I felt like people, things, surroundings were closing in on me from all sides and it made me jump and grab my chest"
It felt like my brain was being massaged. sometimes it felt overwhelming. I think when it became overwhelming my brain would cut to normal thoughts eg like what I need to buy from the shop for dinner. sometimes I would see clips eg like from a film interspersed every now and again
colors shapes stars ac in echo
I felt an overwhelming sense of euphoria and love for everyone in the room. I felt we were journeying together. I felt hopeful.
"I felt very relaxed and comfortable
"
"it was insane
"
"Falling snow, peaceful, lost in a cornfield, staring through a tunnel, scared."
"It felt like Vasarely was flying my brain through space into the warm sunset
"
"A wild experience, I could have stayed in the dream machine all day. Complete disconnection from my body. Strong desire to turn the intensity up and explore more. Visual phases from kaleidoscope to swirls to geometric patterns. Oranges and reds to blues and green, then suddenly black/white only phases. Feeling of motion from floating looking up at the sky, to looking down beneath me, to flying forwards then backwards through a tunnel. "
I feel amazed as I saw a friend from the past who was free by a field on a green hill which made me weep with joy and I saw the poverty of my forebears and loved and thanked them
"The brightest full-vision orange  Never before has my entire sight been orange. Lots of 6 lines in N, S, SW, NE, NW, SE. Mostly red, orange, yellow. But also black, white, blue. I don't know if I ever saw green, pink, brown, purple. There were moments my body jerked like when I try to pee. My mind sometimes was very active and overthinking but I actually have no memory of what. And I always had something very obvious and captivating to come back to."
devtest
an incredible sensory experience with a huge feeling of calm and peace. at times it felt like I was back in the womb.
"sea of green stars moving like oil on water, wading fading. glimpse of something disappearing.
shifting to sharp angled reds, bold lines intersecting like a gate on black.
swirling spheres of orange, turning into a spiral. when the sense of what is happening seems to arrive, the vision vibrates and sense leaves."
"awesome experience, so much  more than I expected. Diolch yn fawr
Tess is very calming"
"strobe lighting  very orange and yellow dominant colors
like the old kaleidoscopes we had as kids
main experience was visual no other senses involved"
psychedelic colors

"Visions of nature - petals, flowers, the sun, a connection between these things and myself. A vast desert of dunes. A multitude of cells, zooming. Shapes both floral and crystalline. Technology and humans. Chaos and stillness."
"Intense visual clarity, ""hyper-resolution"", in an extremely rich 3D!"
"devtest Trev on site
"
"i saw mostly a red diamond kaleidoscope recede into the distance as I zoomed towards it at breakneck speed. in some sense it was tiring. the hallucinations created a very intense and vivid world that if you stayed with it threatened to overwhelm at times. I could feel some sort of physical effect/stress or pressure on the front of my brain, on my face that almost felt as if it was taking a hit from each pulse of light. the moments without the flashing lights were blissful. having taken hallucinogens in the past, it lacked a narrative and an emotional connection comparatively- the scientific nature of the presentation perhaps cutting one off from an emotional and spiritual potential although this is probably highly subjective. it was exhausting in a similar way though. I must go and eat something. "
a time and a place that seem to have happened but has yet to come
"Outside a kaleidoscope of color was a rotating universe of stars, just beyond everything.
At one point it felt like I was looking up at buildings which were white, curved, and modernist, like a futuristic city. "
fabulous experience. I didn't want it to end. It was like having your eyes open throughout and yet totally enveloped in the sound
"I heard  various music patterns,  different speeds, and high and low notes. The music seemed to build to a crescendo near the end of the session and then move into a slower calming sequence. It enhanced the patterns and made it feel like a journey."
"geometric patterns in 2 colors mainly, sometimes with white dots in between. They moved rapidly in my direction from a shape in the center. Sometimes they moved in the opposite direction towards the center point. Like a kaleidoscope but more linear.
There was a helicopter like sound, and then I could see like 2 rotors with geometrical shapes, one in front of each eye.
"
Good vibes
"people talking made me see people walking towards me and it was really
creepy"
"I saw a map of London, I walked through New York, I was floating in space like a star or angel and floating through my past memories forgiving myself for having ever felt sad or numb"
The experience felt like a new form of art in which the individual is the host of their own unique experience
a zen experience
I at times felt a concern that the experience would end too soon
"a portal moving towards me, away from me, through me, fractaling into everything"
"I found the experience very moving and emotional. Transcendental, peaceful although I also felt somewhat anxious.
I participated in a psychedelic trial of DMT 7 months ago and this experience took me back to that. The music especially was on par with how one perceives sound during an actual trip.
I find myself feeling peaceful and present, like back then.
This is a truly amazing experience.Hard to describe.
Thank you for creating it."
"i thought of the universe, it felt, like I was moving moving to the center, drawn in. I saw honeycomb shapes and thought of bees when I saw blocks of color of red or yellow felt  dramatic!"
"The experience felt almost transformative. As the lights started and gradually built, I moved between states of mindfulness and being distracted by everyday thoughts. Sometimes wrestling between the two.  It crescendoed into a cacophony of sound and light where I reached a state of full awareness. My arms were weightless and parts of my body felt distant or unrecognizable."
flashing patterns and music distracted from linear or rational thinking so just sat back and enjoyed sensory pleasure of colors and music.
The Earth falling into the Sun at least once. Nineties rave visuals. The cycle of death and rebirth as envisaged in eighties. A summer meadow. A lot of diamond ripples."
"a direct experience of our infinite creativity.
so much beauty, vivid colors and patterns.
it was like I was traveling between dimensions.
I imagine I would go on a similar journey when I transition to the other realms"
"I spoke to my 8-year-old self and 80-year-old self. They were happy"
like I was particles or a star emitting light into space
"Like an interactive, multicolored, multidimensional Escher painting"
"I really enjoyed the music, it was very Zen."
it
towards the end I went to space. the takeoff was intense and scary but at the end I was floating peacefully in orbit with the glow of the earth below me. I could see the stars above me
"hard to focus on a single pattern and when you wanted to focus on one, it would become less focused. you just had to let them pass through you and you would be able to see them clearer"
it felt like coming home
"Intro was red spirals, almost like a cyclone"
"at first I thought it was really intense, but as I went through the phases, I felt a rush of anxiety taking me through a journey of color; both beautiful and calming, or rigid and uncomfortable, I didn't know where to look. then, all of a sudden I felt like I was disembodied, a huge wave of euphoria took over and I felt like I was totally free, it's the most comfort I've ever felt and it was magical"
"calm serenity, flashback emotions"
"It felt like being at a fun fair on a spinning ride but two next to each other spinning in opposite directions, but the light was a lot more mottled, reds and greens."
I felt like I understood why Islamic architecture features geometric shapes so prominently. because we see these shapes when we close our eyes. obviously spiritual
"the visual experience felt a bit flat as focused in being in my eyes and head experience too much. I would rather engage the body and work on somatic aspect of it. so I dropped into the body to feel more. and it felt like I was a flat surface, like a canvas and my face was a painting on which and images appeared. beautiful! thanks!
"
"I remembered beautiful and joyful memories and moments with my family, as if I was with them at the beach"
I dissolved into light
I felt like I was looking across the Universe beyond any realm of experience. I felt deep connection with humankind and an overwhelming sense of peace. I left feeling profoundly moved and very tearful.
it sparked much curiosity. what do I really understand?
"changing colors. interlocking diamond and triangles faintly distinct. the light appears to grow and shrink.
"
a lot of memories
"A varying journey in speed and awareness. At times so rapid it felt as though the body and brain wouldn't be able to process, while other moments were calm and soothing. Desire to retain and recall shapes colors and feelings evoked were strong, but understanding the experience may be lost once coming out of it."
"Color fields of varying colors which then changed to rapidly moving patterns. Sometimes the patterns appeared to move downwards in front of my eyes, sometimes across my vision, sometimes towards a point of infinity."
"felt like dreaming, I did dream a little"
"brains, neurons, veins, elephants, "
"lots of visuals, but towards the end people I love, and the ancestors, some I did not previously know, these were then apparent to be within an eye, good and bad stories were immaterial, just experiences, then out of the eye into a wider space of colors and reverberating patterns, and there were many eyes with many perceptions born of many lifetimes within them....all these eyes were within the flow of colors. inside and outside the eyes were infinite."
utter peace and happiness
intense connection with my body and surroundings
Being in a busy airport waiting area then landing in Egypt
A great sense of calm and belonging
"A loss of sense of time, images that weren't images. Feeling like I was transported or moving."
"I was in a desert and there were figures moving across the dunes, then I was underwater among the whales. I was viewing the London skyline at one point and this was followed by a helicopter. I saw a lot of orange and blue in bubbly patterns"
"nostalgia and peace. optimism and escapism.
I've visited three times and had a different experience. Once I was wearing contacts and it was more geometric. The last time I saw a lot of white geometric forms mixed with smoke. All of the times I saw hyperspace-style visuals with red and blue"
"Saw x3 distinct images:
1. Staircase/Escalator
2. Treasure Chests (x2 Opening, x1 Closed/Locked)
3. Bookmark Symbol"
Intrigued and excited
"one central heart shape kept returning, it was every color of the rainbow. At one point, the sky immersed me like I was skydiving again. And I went to space and saw galaxies and stars. And lots of kaleidoscope shapes"
A bubbling of freedom. Suddenly seeing somewhere dark yet bright resulting in a tingling sensation through alternative parts of my body but also of pure relaxation
loved it. would like to try it for a couple of hours
"What surprised me this time (4th experience of high sensory) was seeing peripheral live structures - pyramidal shapes.
Another thing which found strange was seeing clearly a pentagram in the center of spiral - normal one as well as reversed and then rotating."
I felt at one point that I saw someone leave the room (like a dream) also we all lifted up and spiraled like a waltzer. I saw many kinds of patterns from sparks to geometric shapes and contrarotating spirals. My feet feel a bit floaty.
"At times I saw a clear blue ocean. I saw people in yellow who were walking past me as if I was on a bus. there were lots of children playing with their parents, throwing balls in the air. various characters who if focused on them would disappear. at the end when everything calmed down I saw a person amongst the white in a hospital bed. I then saw a hazy silhouette of a man walking away from me, he looked over his shoulder before disappearing. finally there was a pregnant mother amongst blue being cradled by her husband. it felt like the circle of life, a soul leaving and returning. I was emotionally moved. it was a wonderful experience I wasn't expecting"
Felt like the llama intro credit scene of monty python holy grail at some points.
thought about god
"A blue and red Cross initially then dots of various colors, at one point they got quite animated and bounced around a fair bit. But then I just dozed off"
"fractals, intense colors, sometimes a mix with memories from single very short
scenes of beautiful situations of the past"
"curiosity, want to control but unable, intense when orange"
"Euphoria
"
"scary pointy laughing clown face in test period. when he came up again later I was able to control him and turned him into a pecking bird.
I was zooming through space, someone wanted to show me their planet far away. I flew over cities and deserts, at one point was flying close to the ground with a herd of elephants.
I met their god with one eye in the middle of their forehead. great sense of adventure and wellbeing, I was the traveler and welcome on their peaceful world"
"I saw a lot of fast movement but despite that emotionally I felt absolute stillness and deep calm. On the periphery of my vision I sometimes saw objects and people. I tried to interpret them first, but then decided just to be fully present in the experience. Overall, I enjoyed the dream machine, I can still feel stillness and some feeling of bliss."
A euphoric and healing experience.
I FELT AS THOUGH I WAS EXPERIENCING THE FORMATION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE EARTH...A PLACE OF WARMTH AND LIGHT ARISING OUT OF DUST AND SPINNING CHAOS SUSPENDED IN AN INFINITE VOID.
"i kept thinking about a game of football I played on Tuesday and how I was hyper aware of my eyes, if they had something in them or something that might pull me away from the experience"
"I saw shapes and waves and azulejo tiles and patchwork of blurry landscapes. There were vague outlines of animals between the shapes, a stag running.  I saw a past love in a wedding dress and another swimming through the ocean."
Unease
"not as good as doing loads of ket but still decent
"
i wish I could do it again. it reminded me of being a child
"
"bizarre. lots of observing others, and in a giant bubble with people coming down being protected by others who control the dome"
I hope that's what death feels like x
"a complete journey. closest sober experience (and to be honest, better) than psychedelics"
"My perception of various geometric constructs. Dyson spheres, mobius strips, rippling water etc. "
" I wondered if it would be like this when you die. Calm and serene and not frightening. I saw lots of warm colors and black and crosses-no green
"
"I didn't know whether I was asleep or awake. I felt like I drifted in and out of consciousness, but never opened my eyes. I felt a range of emotions, sometimes I wanted to laugh and sometimes I felt more of a deep sexual feeling. It was very relaxing, and when I finally opened my eyes I felt refreshed and new."
i was in another world
I saw a serene beach scene with people and text as if it were subtitled in a movie set in the south of France.
my brain being an Oscar-worthy director
"a totally immersive experience it felt like I was inside my very own kaleidoscope. I saw bright yellow, like the sun and it took me to my happy place"
"As the guide's voice began to speak telling us it was over I felt as if the colors had stopped some time before. I realized any interaction had been quite short as my consciousness had drifted into the early stages in which the sandman cometh, where my brain's alpha waves quickly displaced the externally generated momentary visions with the garbled, messy, free association of nonsensical stories that act as the scent kindling of dreams."
EVERYTHING
I felt sleepy and a bit anxious at times due to the speed of the flashing lights. I did not have profound thoughts during the experience but rather almost fell asleep in a dreamlike way
"I was on a rollercoaster into the sun. Don't make me get off!
"
Peaceful contemplation and vivid Mandelbrot type kaleidoscopic patterns
"overall, it was an amazing experience"
"happiness
joy
adventure"
"intense fast movement of sound shapes color and light
it was 100% more immersive than I anticipated"
"no sense of time
"
"whole spectrum of colors and shapes, some  colors never seen before, all of them moving in many directions, piercing through my body and mind. very ecstatic experience that I wished would never end. In the end I felt at home, deep sense of warm loving embrace, like being in mother's womb."
I feel really relaxed and would like to do it again. j if I do I will try and meditate beforehand as I still had racing thoughts interrupting me. I couldn't be totally immersed because I suffer from tinnitus and no matter what it's always a distraction.
I want to do it again!
something wonderful
"it began violent before falling away to darkness
"
"This is my 7th visit.
This would be a great therapy to teach mindfulness and train people to still their thoughts.
Also possibilities for recreational use
Perhaps even people who want to get off drugs.
More DM please!"
"wonderful, peaceful."
A feeling of peace and tranquility
"i was put in a dreamlike semiconscious state, the sensation when you are not quite asleep, coming into wakefulness, and dreaming of real things, conversations.
"
pareidolia. this was unnerving sometimes. amazing experience though.
"I  felt that God's light shone upon me and that I was going back to the beginning of the universe, the Big Bang, and seeing creatures in microcosm - at a cellular level- as well as planets and stars. Also at the end, the depths of the ocean."
like being on acid or DMT but safer!! everyone should try
fascinating experience with great therapeutic potential
Colors like a test card at first lightly muted but then I called pink to mind and saw a wash of deep pink. I also saw some text almost like ancient runes. At one point I felt like I was flying. I remembered some difficult experiences during but afterwards I felt euphoric
"a lot of kaleidoscope flowers, falling blossoms or snowflakes and ripples like raindrops on water"
"Overarching nature and love.
"
"in brief - I was thinking if death could look like this experience, and so I decided to assume that I go through near-death experience and check my thoughts about it, so you could build something more than visual only thing to me, so I cannot say it was totally useless as I was expecting"
different thoughts about the perception of light and the manner in which human discernment develops towards something.
"struggled to let go. thought of how amazing my mind is to make up all those colors, shapes, and images. tried to think about not living in fear,
it's all just an experience. live more!"
I was hurtling through space and time at a speed I couldn't determine. I felt like I experienced the big bang and everything since. It was really hard to put my finger on it. I was shedding different layers of myself and felt connected to all life forms. I felt so much energy pulsating through my body
"It transported me into memories, having a deeper connection than ever before. I could walk around the room and almost reach out, it felt like I was there in my memory looking back at the places. It was so deep I was unsure if I was totally conscious. It felt like almost the dreamlike state of anesthesia"
aware of the music throughout and changing rhythms and tones
"Very interesting experience. Definitely easy to be in the moment. Reminded me of when I used to get bored in school assemblies and press into my eyes to watch the patterns unfold! Most visuals were kaleidoscopic, although I saw a Moroccan landscape and a dolphin swimming away through a cave at various points."
I saw the inside of my eyelids in a whole new way.
Was starting to feel far more significant/interesting emotions when the experience stopped
"I experienced a range of images which is why I chose so many colors and shapes when asked to describe what I saw. perhaps I should have focused on one. I saw octagonal like shapes, I saw rotations and like I was being washed over by yellow light. the most intense part was smooth but heavy and intense red light that mixed with yellow like fire and looked like a spaceship that was moving. Like an eruption of light and an engine firing. Thank you it was very interesting"
"To be quite honest I think I fell asleep so don't really remember what I saw.
"
"I thought the fluffy speech and over written health and safety aspect broke any sense of adventure or departure, was it really necessary? the meditative part was nice perhaps take the intro time up with a brief overview of the history of these pursuits maybe a bit science and lose the faux hand holding. lovely experience overall"
"i thought the fluffy speech and over written health and safety aspect broke any sense of adventure or departure, was it really necessary? the meditative part was nice perhaps take the intro time up with a brief overview of the history of these pursuits maybe a bit science and lose the faux hand holding. lovely experience overall"
An intensity of connection vastness spaciousness loving awareness
"deep relaxation. like a deep tissue massage for the mind. a safe healthy groovy drug-free trip. how long did it last? afterwards I felt as if I had had the deepest  deepest sleep. I worried it might give me a headache but it didn't. great peace. soothed. tired.
"
colorful patterns
Peace and contentment.
"I saw hexagons and a blue tunnel. I thought of bees and generativity. I was pure and full of electricity,"
frustration that I couldn't stop thinking about the outside and concentrate on what was happening. but there were occasional tumbles in the patterns that made me leap back into it
"A really pleasant and relaxing sensation. It was not erotic, but it did make me think of sex in the sense that it struck me how enjoyable it could be to have a sexual experience (alone or with others) in conjunction with or after that sensation.
I also felt like I wanted the experience to be more intense - much louder
music, and the most intense part of the lighting pattern repeated for longer."
some physical discomfort; amazing patterns; intense colors; yearning; desire to see more; questions
"I felt incredibly small, and had the weight of existence over me like a heavy blanket. Rather than a negative experience I felt relief and comforted by it"
"immense comfort, even when much of the experience was frantic. towards the end I saw deep blue snow which was incredibly peaceful"
"lights and colors. a sense of calm. joy.
"
"I very suddenly felt like I had been shot into the air, traveling up through time and space. I saw stars pass overhead, with everything taking on a kaleidoscopic texture. I also saw an analog timer counting up, filling my whole field of view.
"
a perfectly cromulent experience
relaxing and patterned music
a journey into the unknown. a beautiful quest to oblivion
"I experienced different states depending on the lighting - darkness and constant light made me feel relaxed, but the first two levels of strobing made me feel partly overwhelmed and anxious. The final (most rapid?) level of strobing felt more relaxing again."
I felt very powerless and pulled along during the experience. like I was being dragged along a space portal or tunnel at a very high speed. I saw stars and the outlines of planets. I saw a large cross. two wolf shapes facing each other. I saw a large butterfly/dragon shape descending from the stars. I saw a large huge open space patterned with what looked like white and black tiles. I saw large sky-like shapes writhing through the space and tunnel each a different color
"felt out of my body - in fact off planet Earth - like I took a trip into space
"
Calm
"this is my 2nd time. the 1st one was better coz I felt relaxed and I got ideas. this time someone kept coughing and disrupted my thought process. I did not feel anything at all. they should ban people who cough
"
"I was moved by a wild tide of atomic energy, converging around all of us"
"Colors, patterns, and a sense of awe that my brain and light were creating such powerful hallucinations. I was a little afraid at first but it was good to get in touch with my fear and just feel it. It was a beautiful experience."
"similar stuff to what I normally experience
"
"I often felt connected to space, as in floating weightless surrounded by millions of stars. or traveling at great speed through time. Sometimes it felt and looked like wormholes. I felt elated and completely peaceful and found myself smiling broadly at these moments"
"WARM
"
"that was like acid
"
was an interesting experience and after I felt relaxed
just music
"at the end the sharp music connected me to the sound of helicopters with a smell of burning that I associated with a war, for the majority I experienced heart shapes cosmic lights and galaxies"
"Peace tranquility joy stimulation arousal. swirling patterns. geometric shapes shifting and changing I got lost my body disappeared and came back. I had short dreams
"
Thought about how I was feeling and that there were people around me and how it made me feel vulnerable.
"i felt as if I were in outer space or as if I was experiencing a transition after death. it was comforting and whilst I felt small and insignificant, I also felt free and powerful."
Joy and relaxation
i thought throughout I was visualizing my own body specifically my head.
h
my thoughts of this is I felt safe and fun. it gives me an odd feeling of wanting to keep feeling these types of thing again
"cakm
"
lots of colors
I was aware when I started to follow my train of thought I was maybe going deeper into myself and I didn't see as much of the imagery as when I did when I was concentrating on the colors and the shapes. I spent a lot of time thinking about the way I experience the world sensorily and whether it is 'normal' compared to other people.
a wild ride
"a kaleidoscope of light and patterns
"
i was on a journey I was relaxed and not a bit worried as if I knew I would be safe
"random thoughts some connected to people close to me others just events and journeys
"
"A sense of expansion
, moving towards something
Forward motion
Motivation, progress, and purposes
"
"Mainly stressed but with moments of calm when it went dark and blue, I saw lots of colors and patterns but I didn't like a lot of them so found myself hoping it would become a color combination I like or find emotionally peaceful. there was one point where it had a darker background and was starry and had bright pink, yellow and blue shapes dancing which I liked. but most of it had a white background for me which made me feel like I was in a clinical space, that made me stressed, I generally prefer the dark."
Anxiety

"floating in the air and traveling in the universe,

"if you're from the University of Sussex you need to stand up for reality not believe in souls, gendered or otherwise

"Breathing exercise:
it would help if the staff could show us how to do it so we could copy them. The way it was delivered was too fast and too long. it wasn't with my rhythm.
i found the eye mask uncomfortable on my forehead so I took it off. I would prefer to use my hands to shield from the light.
it was a bit too cold for me in the dreamachine especially as we were not moving.
it is quite echoey in the dreamachine and I could hear someone snoring, and when staff was opening & shutting the door near beginning and end.
it might be an idea to have a box of tissues in the reflection room."
"light shapes, emerging and receding patterns folding in and out of each other. kaleidoscope effects. it was also interesting, when an image stabilized, to scan the field of vision up and down and side to side to explore the periphery."
Lots of pulsating spiraling images that did not take specific forms. at
"I experienced a lot of physical sensations in my stomach, on my face and inside my head. I still feel it now. Like my brain has been massaged. "
"something that I had ever experienced before, something I wish I could do once a week"
I kept seeing images of people
vertigo
entry another universe
"saw vertical tree branches with green leaves towards the end, felt as
 though was moving in a sleep state at that point"
"I also experienced ghost people in my peripheral vision. sometimes fleeting or felt they were walking around the room. wispy and milky in appearance.
I am also dyslexic and it was interesting to experience as neurodivergent brained person"
"for someone who has sleep paralysis regularly, this was quite interesting. my brain automatically reached for the details that prove this wasn't ""real"", and I felt very much present. couldn't meditate either, even though I tried. the visuals were pretty fun though"
sequential rich kaleidoscopic patterning with a sense of depth structures felt elite and natural rather than architectural or fantastical or transcendental.
A kaleidoscopic 'Be our Guest' from Beauty & The Beast experience. I kept seeing happy spinning teapots!
"having had many psychedelic
lic experiences over many years it was tame, interested in potential for taking it further, combining it with substances."
peace
"peace
sunlight
nature
"
"Felt being pulled through a vortex of time, waiting to awake in a different dimension!"
healing a part of myself I didn't realize had decayed entirely
felt like I was on that boat in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
"deep memories and emotive reflections. images I've seen before.
"
"I saw something like a Moroccan tile pattern based around small geometric crosses and diagonals, lots of them, lots of flickering and moving, sometimes focusing particularly to one shape more than the others. This was all very colorful - lots of small different blocks of color, but repetitive, as in the shapes and colors repeated. Sometimes a couple of colors became more dominant, like blue and red, or a more fluffy green pattern.  A couple of times the small geometric shapes started as gray / black & white. Sometimes (felt like beginnings and ends of musical or light episodes) there were periods of stillness with just one color, mainly a warm yellow, or an orangey red. "
stimulation and relaxation within the music and light
"I saw incredible kaleidoscopes of patterns made of solid stripes of color. Through the edges of the kaleidoscopes I started to see corridors and gardens, as though there were doorways to imagined worlds inside the patterns.
 At one moment when it was darker I saw a deep mass of blue-green sparks that pulsed almost like a jellyfish.
I wanted to stay in that space and see more of those worlds."
"space even if I've never been physically there
"
"A mass of moving shapes and the
 most vivid colors, continually changing, evolving and enveloping "
amazing sense of peace and positivity
very interesting!
"Colors and lines and spheres and twirls
"
"
sensory rollercoaster"
really just thoughts from my day or things I need to do or had forgotten to do.
"Seeing figures wearing black hats at the height of the music, bands of stars twirling, tunnels slanting right and left as well as zooming in, and the creamsicle room. totally disorienting until I picked a spot or tried to blink. lots of uncertainty but it went okay."
"Quite a few meshes orders of dark colors emerging from blackness but at one point
 hexagons of pulsating pink and black began punching me from both sides alternately
It lasted about 6 seconds but if it had gone on longer I would have had to"
"I felt relaxed, safe and excited at the start of the experience. Then I began to float through a tunnel filled with bright red and blue light into outer space or some other dimension. My body felt heavy with a sense of sinking down, but at the same time I was flying forward. As the experience intensified, I felt euphoric and emotional. Like I was on an LSD trip, an out of body sensation when I am on drugs. It was quite satisfying. I think it helped me process some of the trauma I had with drug use. At the end of the journey, I was back to Earth floating in dark blue, purple water. I wanted it to go on forever."
"ever-shifting visions, often kaleidoscopic, geometric, or cosmic, which were linked to the music and could be shaped by intention, but obliquely and mysteriously. As if taken through alternate realities by an unintelligible but considerate guide!"
"A geometrical, rhythmic, pulsating cosmos in front of my eyes. It was infinitely varied and beautiful. I will return in my own time without the help of the dream machine."
Seeing and hearing my deceased relatives. They all smiled and I could hear their distinctive voices...
life death and rebirth
"red all red
shapes and travel through time
"
"Anxious&overwhelmed, total lack of control at first. I realized I had to give myself (entregarme) to the experience if I wanted to feel it. An emotional and somatic understanding that control has no place here. Then I saw planets revolving rapidly, almost colliding. Me in a spaceship traveling so fast I felt I was leaving my body behind. Approaching the sun and its heat. Then a cartoonish face of a man with a mustache reflected like a disco light, and ceiling fans that I approached and zoomed out of (from the collective of many fans to the intricacies of the single fan). Then I jumped into my own bloodstream, I could see the red blood cells traveling in its flow with me, I could almost feel the warmth of my own blood as I floated and flowed in it. Then a squirrel, and bioluminescence of the ocean, la gigi, to end"
huge 3D landscapes. Flashing backgrounds undulating into the foreground quickly becoming a new perspective
I felt warm and cold sensations in my hands at one point and was very relaxed and sleepy by the end. I found the flashing lights a little intense but the eye mask worked well for me during those times. Overall an enjoyable and relaxing experience.
"A collection of keyholes that I could see a painting through, animals and merpeople morphing into each other, wireframe structures, an 'Up' (the animated movie)-style montage of my future?"
"Changing temperature of my body with the lights.
Changes in intensity of the experience when I focused compared to when the light was across my whole peripheral vision."
pleasure & intrigue
"traveling through space
"
"I thought a lot about Rand's journey into Rhuidean and experiencing the
history of the Aiel through the eyes of his ancestors "
"the visual here doesn't look anything like what I saw. was much more geometric, kaleidoscopic, not at all sky like."
